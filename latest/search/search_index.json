The fixed-radius near-neighbors problem is defined as follows: For point p, find all points p' s.t. d(p, p') < r Where in this case d(p, p') is euclidean distance, and r is the fixed radius. For n points with an average of k neighbors each, this data structure can perform m near-neighbor queries (to generate lists of near-neighbors for m different points) in O(mk) time. By contrast, using a k-d tree for successive nearest-neighbor queries results in a running time of O(m log n) . The spatial hash works as follows: Each point is assigned to a bin in the predefined bounding area defined by x_min/x_max and y_min/y_max This can be done by converting x and y position into x and y index respectively For example with the bin containing x_min and y_min as index (0, 0) The two (or more) indices can then be converted into a single index Once every point of interest has been inserted into the hash, near-neighbor queries can begin: The bin of the reference point is first computed For each point in each adjacent bin, perform an explicit distance computation between said point and the reference point. If the distance is below the given radius, said point is considered to be a near-neighbor Under the hood, an std::unordered_multimap is used, where the key is a bin/voxel index. The bin size was computed to be the same as the lookup distance. In addition, this data structure can support 2D or 3D queries. This is determined during configuration, and baked into the data structure via the configuration class. The purpose of this was to avoid if statements in tight loops. The configuration class specializations themselves use CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Patterns) to do \"static polymorphism\", and avoid a dispatching call. Performance characterization # Time # Insertion is O(n) because lookup time for the underlying hashmap is O(n) for hashmaps. In practice, lookup time for hashmaps and thus insertion time should be O(1) . Removing a point is O(1) because the current API only supports removal via direct reference to a node. Finding k near-neighbors is worst case O(n) in the case of an adversarial example, but in practice O(k) . Space # The module consists of the following components: The internal hashmap is O(n + n + A * n) , where A is an arbitrary constant (load factor) The other components of the spatial hash are O(n + n) This results in O(n) space complexity. States # The spatial hash's state is dictated by the status of the underlying unordered_multimap. The data structure is wholly configured by a config class.

The fixed-radius near-neighbors problem is defined as follows: For point p, find all points p' s.t. d(p, p') < r Where in this case d(p, p') is euclidean distance, and r is the fixed radius. For n points with an average of k neighbors each, this data structure can perform m near-neighbor queries (to generate lists of near-neighbors for m different points) in O(mk) time. By contrast, using a k-d tree for successive nearest-neighbor queries results in a running time of O(m log n) . The spatial hash works as follows: Each point is assigned to a bin in the predefined bounding area defined by x_min/x_max and y_min/y_max This can be done by converting x and y position into x and y index respectively For example with the bin containing x_min and y_min as index (0, 0) The two (or more) indices can then be converted into a single index Once every point of interest has been inserted into the hash, near-neighbor queries can begin: The bin of the reference point is first computed For each point in each adjacent bin, perform an explicit distance computation between said point and the reference point. If the distance is below the given radius, said point is considered to be a near-neighbor Under the hood, an std::unordered_multimap is used, where the key is a bin/voxel index. The bin size was computed to be the same as the lookup distance. In addition, this data structure can support 2D or 3D queries. This is determined during configuration, and baked into the data structure via the configuration class. The purpose of this was to avoid if statements in tight loops. The configuration class specializations themselves use CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Patterns) to do \"static polymorphism\", and avoid a dispatching call.","title":"Spatial Hash"},{"location":"common/autoware_auto_geometry/design/spatial-hash-design/#performance-characterization","text":"","title":"Performance characterization"},{"location":"common/autoware_auto_geometry/design/spatial-hash-design/#time","text":"Insertion is O(n) because lookup time for the underlying hashmap is O(n) for hashmaps.

Also check that the input VehicleKinematicState has appropriate values (speed: vehicle rear-wheels-center velocity [km/h], angle: steering (tire) angle [rad]). These values give a vehicle information to the controller for path following. Errors in these values cause fundamental tracking error. Set appropriate vehicle dynamics parameters of steering_tau , which is the approximated delay from steering angle command to actual steering angle. Set weight_steering_input = 1.0, weight_lat_error = 0.1, and other weights to 0. If the vehicle oscillates when driving with low speed, set weight_lat_error smaller. Adjust other weights. One of the simple way for tuning is to increase weight_lat_error until oscillation occurs. If the vehicle is unstable with very small weight_lat_error , increase terminal weight : weight_terminal_lat_error and weight_terminal_heading_error to improve tracking stability. Larger prediction_horizon and smaller prediction_sampling_time is effective for tracking performance, but it is a trade-off between computational costs. Other parameters can be adjusted like below. weight_lat_error : Reduce lateral tracking error. This acts like P gain in PID. weight_heading_error : Make a drive straight. This acts like D gain in PID. weight_heading_error_squared_vel_coeff : Make a drive straight in high speed range. weight_steering_input : Reduce oscillation of tracking. weight_steering_input_squared_vel_coeff : Reduce oscillation of tracking in high speed range. weight_lat_jerk : Reduce lateral jerk. weight_terminal_lat_error : Preferable to set a higher value than normal lateral weight weight_lat_error for stability. weight_terminal_heading_error : Preferable to set a higher value than normal heading weight weight_heading_error for stability.

It also contains a slope force correction that takes into account road slope information, and a delay compensation function. It is assumed that the target acceleration calculated here will be properly realized by the vehicle interface. Note that the use of this module is not mandatory for Autoware if the vehicle supports the \"target speed\" interface. Design / Inner-workings / Algorithms # States # This module has four state transitions as shown below in order to handle special processing in a specific situation. DRIVE Executes target velocity tracking by PID control. It also applies the delay compensation and slope compensation. STOPPING Controls the motion just before stopping. Special sequence is performed to achieve accurate and smooth stopping. STOPPED Performs operations in the stopped state (e.g. brake hold) EMERGENCY . Enters an emergency state when certain conditions are met (e.g., when the vehicle has crossed a certain distance of a stop line). The recovery condition (whether or not to keep emergency state until the vehicle completely stops) or the deceleration in the emergency state are defined by parameters. The state transition diagram is shown below. Logics # Control Block Diagram # FeedForward (FF) # The reference acceleration set in the trajectory and slope compensation terms are output as a feedforward. Under ideal conditions with no modeling error, this FF term alone should be sufficient for velocity tracking. Tracking errors causing modeling or discretization errors are removed by the feedback control (now using PID). Brake keeping # From the viewpoint of ride comfort, stopping with 0 acceleration is important because it reduces the impact of braking. However, if the target acceleration when stopping is 0, the vehicle may cross over the stop line or accelerate a little in front of the stop line due to vehicle model error or gradient estimation error.

Cons: Does not support free space planning (for now) PID control # For deviations that cannot be handled by FeedForward control, such as model errors, PID control is used to construct a feedback system. This PID control calculates the target acceleration from the deviation between the current ego-velocity and the target velocity. This PID logic has a maximum value for the output of each term. This is to prevent the following: Large integral terms may cause unintended behavior by users. Unintended noise may cause the output of the derivative term to be very large. Also, the integral term is not accumulated when the vehicle is stopped. This is to prevent unintended accumulation of the integral term in cases such as \"Autoware assumes that the vehicle is engaged, but an external system has locked the vehicle to start. On the other hand, if the vehicle gets stuck in a depression in the road surface when starting, the vehicle will not start forever, which is currently being addressed by developers. At present, PID control is implemented from the viewpoint of trade-off between development/maintenance cost and performance. This may be replaced by a higher performance controller (adaptive control or robust control) in future development. Time delay compensation # At high speeds, the delay of actuator systems such as gas pedals and brakes has a significant impact on driving accuracy. Depending on the actuating principle of the vehicle, the mechanism that physically controls the gas pedal and brake typically has a delay of about a hundred millisecond. In this controller, the predicted ego-velocity and the target velocity after the delay time are calculated and used for the feedback to address the time delay problem.

Cons: Does not support free space planning (for now) Assumptions / Known limits # Smoothed target velocity and its acceleration shall be set in the trajectory The velocity command is not smoothed inside the controller (only noise may be removed). For step-like target signal, tracking is performed as fast as possible. The vehicle velocity must be an appropriate value The ego-velocity must be a signed-value corresponding to the forward/backward direction The ego-velocity should be given with appropriate noise processing. If there is a large amount of noise in the ego-velocity, the tracking performance will be significantly reduced. The output of this controller must be achieved by later modules (e.g. vehicle interface). If the vehicle interface does not have the target velocity or acceleration interface (e.g., the vehicle only has a gas pedal and brake interface), an appropriate conversion must be done after this controller.

How to tune EKF parameters # 0. Preliminaries # Check header time in pose and twist message is set to sensor time appropriately, because time delay is calculated from this value. If it is difficult to set an appropriate time due to the timer synchronization problem, use twist_additional_delay and pose_additional_delay to correct the time. Check if the relation between measurement pose and twist is appropriate (whether the derivative of the pose has a similar value to twist). This discrepancy is caused mainly by unit error (such as confusing radian/degree) or bias noise, and it causes large estimation errors. 1. Tune sensor parameters # Set standard deviation for each sensor. The pose_measure_uncertainty_time is for the uncertainty of the header timestamp data. You can also tune a number of steps for smoothing for each observed sensor data by tuning *_smoothing_steps . Increasing the number will improve the smoothness of the estimation, but may have an adverse effect on the estimation performance. pose_measure_uncertainty_time pose_smoothing_steps twist_smoothing_steps 2. Tune process model parameters # proc_stddev_vx_c : set to maximum linear acceleration proc_stddev_wz_c : set to maximum angular acceleration proc_stddev_yaw_c : This parameter describes the correlation between the yaw and yawrate. A large value means the change in yaw does not correlate to the estimated yawrate. If this is set to 0, it means the change in estimated yaw is equal to yawrate. Usually, this should be set to 0. proc_stddev_yaw_bias_c : This parameter is the standard deviation for the rate of change in yaw bias. In most cases, yaw bias is constant, so it can be very small, but must be non-zero.

NDT(R,t) stands for the pure NDT cost function. The regularization term shifts the optimal solution to the base position in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Only errors along the longitudinal direction with respect to the base position are considered; errors along Z-axis and lateral-axis error are not considered. Although the regularization term has rotation as a parameter, the gradient and hessian associated with it is not computed to stabilize the optimization. Specifically, the gradients are computed as follows. \\begin{align} &g_x=\\nabla_x \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) + 2 \\mathrm{scale\\ factor} \\cos\\theta_z\\cdot e_{\\mathrm{longitudinal}} \\\\ &g_y=\\nabla_y \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) + 2 \\mathrm{scale\\ factor} \\sin\\theta_z\\cdot e_{\\mathrm{longitudinal}} \\\\ &g_z=\\nabla_z \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) \\\\ &g_\\mathbf{R}=\\nabla_\\mathbf{R} \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) \\end{align} \\begin{align} &g_x=\\nabla_x \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) + 2 \\mathrm{scale\\ factor} \\cos\\theta_z\\cdot e_{\\mathrm{longitudinal}} \\\\ &g_y=\\nabla_y \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) + 2 \\mathrm{scale\\ factor} \\sin\\theta_z\\cdot e_{\\mathrm{longitudinal}} \\\\ &g_z=\\nabla_z \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) \\\\ &g_\\mathbf{R}=\\nabla_\\mathbf{R} \\mathrm{NDT}(\\mathbf{R},\\mathbf{t}) \\end{align} Regularization is disabled by default. If you wish to use it, please edit the following parameters to enable it. Where is regularization available # This feature is effective on feature-less roads where GNSS is available, such as bridges highways farm roads By remapping the base position topic to something other than GNSS, as described below, it can be valid outside of these. Using other base position # Other than GNSS, you can give other global position topics obtained from magnetic markers, visual markers or etc. if they are available in your environment. (Currently Autoware does not provide a node that gives such pose.) To use your topic for regularization, you need to remap the input_regularization_pose_topic with your topic in ndt_scan_matcher.launch.xml . By default, it is remapped with /sensing/gnss/pose_with_covariance . Limitations # Since this function determines the base position by linear interpolation from the recently subscribed poses, topics that are published at a low frequency relative to the driving speed cannot be used. Inappropriate linear interpolation may result in bad optimization results. When using GNSS for base location, the regularization can have negative effects in tunnels, indoors, and near skyscrapers. This is because if the base position is far off from the true value, NDT scan matching may converge to inappropriate optimal position. Parameters # Name Type Description regularization_enabled bool Flag to add regularization term to NDT optimization (FALSE by default) regularization_scale_factor double Coefficient of the regularization term. Regularization is disabled by default because GNSS is not always accurate enough to serve the appropriate base position in any scenes. If the scale_factor is too large, the NDT will be drawn to the base position and scan matching may fail. Conversely, if it is too small, the regularization benefit will be lost. Note that setting scale_factor to 0 is equivalent to disabling regularization. Example # The following figures show tested maps. The left is a map with enough features that NDT can successfully localize. The right is a map with so few features that the NDT cannot localize well. The following figures show the trajectories estimated on the feature-less map with standard NDT and regularization-enabled NDT, respectively. The color of the trajectory indicates the error (meter) from the reference trajectory, which is computed with the feature-rich map. The left figure shows that the pure NDT causes a longitudinal error in the bridge and is not able to recover. The right figure shows that the regularization suppresses the longitudinal error.","title":"ndt_scan_matcher"},{"location":"localization/ndt_scan_matcher/#ndt_scan_matcher","text":"","title":"ndt_scan_matcher"},{"location":"localization/ndt_scan_matcher/#purpose","text":"ndt_scan_matcher is a package for position estimation using the NDT scan matching method.

The default parameters are set so that the lane change can be detected 1 second before the vehicle crosses the lane boundary. Here, 15 data in the lane change / non lane change cases are plotted. On the top plot, blue dots are the distance from the lane boundary one second before the lane change, and red dots are the average distance from the lane boundary when driving straight.

EKF Tracker # Models for pedestrians, bicycles (motorcycles), cars and unknown are available. The pedestrian or bicycle tracker is running at the same time as the respective EKF model in order to enable the transition between pedestrian and bicycle tracking. For big vehicles such as trucks and buses, we have separate models for passenger cars and large vehicles because they are difficult to distinguish from passenger cars and are not stable. Therefore, separate models are prepared for passenger cars and big vehicles, and these models are run at the same time as the respective EKF models to ensure stability.

At this time, each point belonging to each bin is stored as range data. In addition, the x,y information in the map coordinate is also stored for ray trace on map coordinate. The bin contains the following information for each point range data from origin of raytrace x on map coordinate y on map coordinate The following figure shows each of the bins from side view. 2nd step # The ray trace is performed in three steps for each cell. The ray trace is done by Bresenham's line algorithm. Initialize freespace to the farthest point of each bin. Fill in the unknown cells. Assume that unknown is behind the obstacle, since the back of the obstacle is a blind spot. Therefore, the unknown are assumed to be the cells that are more than a distance margin from each obstacle point. There are three reasons for setting a distance margin. It is unlikely that a point on the ground will be immediately behind an obstacle. The obstacle point cloud is processed and may not match the raw pointcloud.

Lane Change : Performs a lane change. This module is performed when it is necessary and a collision check with other vehicles is cleared. Obstacle Avoidance : Perform an obstacle avoidance. This module is for avoidance of a vehicle parked on the edge of the lane or overtaking a low-speed obstacle. Pull Over : Performs a pull over.

To prevent the quantization from causing instability to the planning modules, drivable area's pose follows the rules below. Drivable area is generated in the map coordinate. Its position is quantized with drivable_area_resolution . Its orientation is 0. The size of the drivable area changes dynamically to realize both decreasing the computation cost and covering enough lanes to follow. For the second purpose, the drivable area covers a certain length forward and backward lanes with some margins defined by parameters. Parameters for drivable area generation # Name Unit Type Description Default value drivable_area_resolution [m] double resolution of the image of the drivable area 0.1 drivable_lane_forward_length [m] double length of the forward lane from the ego covered by the drivable area 50.0 drivable_lane_backward_length [m] double length of the backward lane from the ego covered by the drivable area 5.0 drivable_lane_margin [m] double forward and backward lane margin from the ego covered by the drivable area 3.0 drivable_area_margin [m] double margin of width and height of the drivable area 6.0 Behavior Tree # In the behavior path planner, the behavior tree mechanism is used to manage which modules are activated in which situations. In general, this \"behavior manager\" like function is expected to become bigger as more and more modules are added in the future. To improve maintainability, we adopted the behavior tree. The behavior tree has the following advantages: easy visualization, easy configuration management (behaviors can be changed by replacing configuration files), and high scalability compared to the state machine. The current behavior tree structure is shown below. Each modules (LaneChange, Avoidance, etc) have Request , Ready , and Plan nodes as a common function. Request : Check if there is a request from the module (e.g. LaneChange has a request when there are multi-lanes and the vehicle is not on the preferred lane), Ready : Check if it is safe to execute the plan (e.g. LaneChange is ready when the lane_change path does not have any conflicts with other dynamic objects on S-T space). Plan : Calculates path and set it to the output of the BehaviorTree. Until the internal status returns SUCCESS, it will be in running state and will not transit to another module. ForceApproval : A lane change-specific node that overrides the result of Ready when a forced lane change command is given externally. Lane Following # Generate path from center line of the route. special case # In the case of a route that requires a lane change, the path is generated with a specific distance margin (default: 12.0 m ) from the end of the lane to ensure the minimum distance for lane change. (This function works not only for lane following but also for all modules.) Lane Change # The Lane Change module is activated when lane change is needed and can be safely executed. start lane change condition (need to meet all of the conditions below) # lane change request condition The ego-vehicle isn\u2019t on a preferred_lane . There is neither intersection nor crosswalk on the path of the lane change lane change ready condition Path of the lane change doesn\u2019t collide with other objects (see the figure below) Lane change is allowed by an operator finish lane change condition (need to meet any of the conditions below) # Certain distance (default: 3.0 m ) have passed after the vehicle move to the target lane. Before the base_link exceeds white dotted line, a collision with the object was predicted (only if enable_abort_lane_change is true.) However, when current velocity is lower than 10km/h and the ego-vehicle is near the lane end, the lane change isn\u2019t aborted and the ego-vehicle plans to stop. Then, after no collision is predicted, the ego-vehicle resume the lane change. Collision prediction with obstacles # Predict each position of the ego-vehicle and other vehicle on the target lane of the lane change at t1, t2,...tn If a distance between the ego-vehicle and other one is lower than the threshold ( ego_velocity * stop_time (2s) ) at each time, that is judged as a collision Path Generation # Path to complete the lane change in n + m seconds under an assumption that a velocity of the ego-vehicle is constant. Once the lane change is executed, the path won\u2019t be updated until the \"finish-lane-change-condition\" is satisfied. Avoidance # The Avoidance module is activated when dynamic objects to be avoided exist and can be safely avoided. Target objects # Dynamic objects that satisfy the following conditions are considered to be avoidance targets. Semantics type is CAR , TRUCK , or BUS low speed (default: < 1.0 m/s ) Not being around center line (default: deviation from center > 0.5 m ) Any footprint of the object in on the detection area (driving lane + 1 m margin for lateral direction). How to generate avoidance path # To prevent sudden changes in the vicinity of the ego-position, an avoidance path is generated after a certain distance of straight lane driving. The process of generating the avoidance path is as follows: detect the target object and calculate the lateral shift distance (default: 2.0 m from closest footprint point) calculate the avoidance distance within the constraint of lateral jerk. (default: 0.3 ~ 2.0 m/s3 ) If the maximum jerk constraint is exceeded to keep the straight margin, the avoidance path generation is aborted. generates the smooth path with given avoiding distance and lateral shift length. generate \"return to center\" path if there is no next target within a certain distance (default: 50 m ) after the current target. single objects case # multiple objects case # If there are multiple avoidance targets and the lateral distances of these are close (default: < 0.5m ), those objects are considered as a single avoidance target and avoidance is performed simultaneously with a single steering operation. If the lateral distances of the avoidance targets differ greatly than threshold, multiple steering operations are used to avoid them. Smooth path generation # The path generation is computed in Frenet coordinates. The shift length profile for avoidance is generated by four segmental constant jerk polynomials, and added to the original path. Since the lateral jerk can be approximately seen as a steering maneuver, this calculation yields a result similar to a Clothoid curve. Unimplemented parts / limitations for avoidance # collision check is not implemented shift distance should be variable depending on the situation (left/right is free or occupied). Now it is a fixed value. collaboration with \"avoidance-by-lane-change\". specific rules for traffic condition (need to back to the center line before entering an intersection). Pull Over # The Pull Over module is activated when goal is in the shoulder lane. Ego-vehicle will stop at the goal. start pull over condition (need to meet all of the conditions below) # Pull over request condition The goal is in shoulder lane and the ego-vehicle is in road lane. The distance between the goal and ego-vehicle is somewhat close. It is shorter than request_length (default: < 200m ). Pull over ready condition It is always ready if the conditions of the request are met. Pull over start condition Generate safe parking goal and path. The generated path does not collide with obstacles. Pull over is allowed by an operator If pull over path is not allowed by an operator, leave distance required for pull over and stop. finish pull over condition (need to meet any of the conditions below) # The distance to the goal from your vehicle is lower than threshold (default: < 1m ) The ego-vehicle is stopped.

Purpose / Role # This module is designed for rule-based avoidance that is easy for developers to design its behavior. It generates avoidance path parameterized by intuitive parameters such as lateral jerk and avoidance distance margin. This makes it possible to pre-define avoidance behavior. In addition, the approval interface of behavior_path_planner allows external users / modules (e.g. remote operation) to intervene the decision of the vehicle behavior.\u3000 This function is expected to be used, for example, for remote intervention in emergency situations or gathering information on operator decisions during development. Limitations # This module allows developers to design vehicle behavior in avoidance planning using specific rules. Due to the property of rule-based planning, the algorithm can not compensate for not colliding with obstacles in complex cases. This is a trade-off between \"be intuitive and easy to design\" and \"be hard to tune but can handle many cases\". This module adopts the former policy and therefore this output should be checked more strictly in the later stage. In the .iv reference implementation, there is another avoidance module in motion planning module that uses optimization to handle the avoidance in complex cases. (Note that, the motion planner needs to be adjusted so that the behavior result will not be changed much in the simple case and this is a typical challenge for the behavior-motion hierarchical architecture.) Why is avoidance in behavior module? # This module executes avoidance over lanes, and the decision requires the lane structure information to take care of traffic rules (e.g. it needs to send an indicator signal when the vehicle crosses a lane). The difference between motion and behavior module in the planning stack is whether the planner takes traffic rules into account, which is why this avoidance module exists in the behavior module. Inner-workings / Algorithms # The following figure shows a simple explanation of the logic for avoidance path generation. First, target objects are picked up, and shift requests are generated for each object. These shift requests are generated by taking into account the lateral jerk required for avoidance (red lines). Then these requests are merged and the shift points are created on the reference path (blue line). Filtering operations are performed on the shift points such as removing unnecessary shift points (yellow line), and finally a smooth avoidance path is generated by combining Clothoid-like curve primitives (green line). Flowchart # Details of Functions # How to decide the target obstacles # The avoidance target should be limited to stationary objects (you should not avoid a vehicle waiting at a traffic light even if it blocks your path). Therefore, target vehicles for avoidance should meet the following specific conditions. It is in the vicinity of your lane (parametrized) It is stopped (estimated speed is lower than threshold) This means that overtaking is not supported (will be supported in the future). It is a specific class. User can limit avoidance targets (e.g. do not avoid unknown-class targets). It is not being in the center of the route This means that the vehicle is parked on the edge of the lane. This prevents the vehicle from avoiding a vehicle waiting at a traffic light in the middle of the lane. However, this is not an appropriate implementation for the purpose. Even if a vehicle is in the center of the lane, it should be avoided if it has its hazard lights on, and this is a point that should be improved in the future as the recognition performance improves. Compensation for detection lost # In order to prevent chattering of recognition results, once an obstacle is targeted, it is hold for a while even if it disappears. This is effective when recognition is unstable. However, since it will result in over-detection (increase a number of false-positive), it is necessary to adjust parameters according to the recognition accuracy (if object_last_seen_threshold = 0.0 , the recognition result is 100% trusted). Computing Shift Length and Shift Points # The lateral shift length is affected by 4 variables, namely lateral_collision_safety_buffer , lateral_collision_margin , vehicle_width and overhang_distance . The equation is as follows max_allowable_lateral_distance = lateral_collision_margin + lateral_collision_safety_buffer + 0.5 * vehicle_width shift_length = max_allowable_lateral_distance - overhang_distance The following figure illustrates these variables. Rationale of having safety buffer and safety margin # To compute the shift length, additional parameters that can be tune are lateral_collision_safety_buffer and road_shoulder_safety_margin . The lateral_collision_safety_buffer parameter is used to set a safety gap that will act as the final line of defense when computing avoidance path. The rationale behind having this parameter is that the parameter lateral_collision_margin might be changing according to the situation for various reasons. Therefore, lateral_collision_safety_buffer will act as the final line of defense in case of the usage of lateral_collision_margin fails. It is recommended to set the value to more than half of the ego vehicle's width. The road_shoulder_safety_margin will prevent the module from generating a path that might cause the vehicle to go too near the road shoulder or adjacent lane dividing line. Generating path only within lanelet boundaries # The shift length is set as a constant value before the feature is implemented. Setting the shift length like this will cause the module to generate an avoidance path regardless of actual environmental properties. For example, the path might exceed the actual road boundary or go towards a wall. Therefore, to address this limitation, in addition to how to decide the target obstacle , the module also takes into account the following additional element The obstacles' current lane and position. The road shoulder with reference to the direction to avoid. These elements are used to compute the distance from the object to the road's shoulder ( to_road_shoulder_distance ). The parameters enable_avoidance_over_same_direction and enable_avoidance_over_opposite_direction allows further configuration of the to to_road_shoulder_distance . The following image illustrates the configuration. If the following condition is false , then the shift point will not be generated. max_allowable_lateral_distance <= ( to_road_shoulder_distance - 0.5 * vehicle_width - road_shoulder_safety_margin ) Flow-chart of the process # How to decide the path shape # Generate shift points for obstacles with given lateral jerk. These points are integrated to generate an avoidance path. The detailed process flow for each case corresponding to the obstacle placement are described below. The actual implementation is not separated for each case, but the function corresponding to multiple obstacle case (both directions) is always running. One obstacle case # The lateral shift distance to the obstacle is calculated, and then the shift point is generated from the ego vehicle speed and the given lateral jerk as shown in the figure below. A smooth avoidance path is then calculated based on the shift point. Additionally, the following processes are executed in special cases. Lateral jerk relaxation conditions # If the ego vehicle is close to the avoidance target, the lateral jerk will be relaxed up to the maximum jerk When returning to the center line after avoidance, if there is not enough distance left to the goal (end of path), the jerk condition will be relaxed as above. Minimum velocity relaxation conditions # There is a problem that we can not know the actual speed during avoidance in advance. This is especially critical when the ego vehicle speed is 0. To solve that, this module provides a parameter for the minimum avoidance speed, which is used for the lateral jerk calculation when the vehicle speed is low. If the ego vehicle speed is lower than \"nominal\" minimum speed, use the minimum speed in the calculation of the jerk. If the ego vehicle speed is lower than \"sharp\" minimum speed and a nominal lateral jerk is not enough for avoidance (the case where the ego vehicle is stopped close to the obstacle), use the \"sharp\" minimum speed in the calculation of the jerk (it should be lower than \"nominal\" speed). Multiple obstacle case (one direction) # Generate shift points for multiple obstacles. All of them are merged to generate new shift points along the reference path. The new points are filtered (e.g. remove small-impact shift points), and the avoidance path is computed for the filtered shift points. Merge process of raw shift points : check the shift length on each path points. If the shift points are overlapped, the maximum shift value is selected for the same direction. For the details of the shift point filtering, see filtering for shift points . Multiple obstacle case (both direction) # Generate shift points for multiple obstacles. All of them are merged to generate new shift points. If there are areas where the desired shifts conflict in different directions, the sum of the maximum shift amounts of these areas is used as the final shift amount. The rest of the process is the same as in the case of one direction. Filtering for shift points # The shift points are modified by a filtering process in order to get the expected shape of the avoidance path. It contains the following filters. Quantization: Quantize the avoidance width in order to ignore small shifts. Small shifts removal: Shifts with small changes with respect to the previous shift point are unified in the previous shift width. Similar gradient removal: Connect two shift points with a straight line, and remove the shift points in between if their shift amount is in the vicinity of the straight line. Remove momentary returns: For shift points that reduce the avoidance width (for going back to the center line), if there is enough long distance in the longitudinal direction, remove them.

This is because it is impossible to predict how the environment will change during the stop.\u3000 This is especially important at intersections. Safety Check In the current implementation, it is only the jerk limit that permits the avoidance execution. It is needed to consider the collision with other vehicles when change the path shape. Consideration of the speed of the avoidance target In the current implementation, only stopped vehicle is targeted as an avoidance target. It is needed to support the overtaking function for low-speed vehicles, such as a bicycle. (It is actually possible to overtake the low-speed objects by changing the parameter, but the logic is not supported and thus the safety cannot be guaranteed.) The overtaking (e.g., to overtake a vehicle running in front at 20 km/h at 40 km/h) may need to be handled outside the avoidance module. It should be discussed which module should handle it. Cancel avoidance when target disappears In the current implementation, even if the avoidance target disappears, the avoidance path will remain. If there is no longer a need to avoid, it must be canceled. Improved performance of avoidance target selection Essentially, avoidance targets are judged based on whether they are static objects or not. For example, a vehicle waiting at a traffic light should not be avoided because we know that it will start moving in the future. However this decision cannot be made in the current Autoware due to the lack of the perception functions. Therefore, the current avoidance module limits the avoidance target to vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road, and executes avoidance only for vehicles that are stopped away from the center of the lane. However, this logic cannot avoid a vehicle that has broken down and is stopped in the center of the lane, which should be recognized as a static object by the perception module. There is room for improvement in the performance of this decision. Resampling path Now the rough resolution resampling is processed to the output path in order to reduce the computational cost for the later modules. This resolution is set to a uniformly large value \u3000(e.g. 5m ), but small resolution should be applied for complex paths. How to debug # Publishing Visualization Marker # Developers can see what is going on in each process by visualizing all the avoidance planning process outputs.

Then add the marker /planning/scenario_planning/lane_driving/behavior_planning/behavior_path_planner/debug/avoidance in rviz2 . Echoing debug message to find out why the objects were ignored # If for some reason, no shift point is generated for your object, you can check for the failure reason via ros2 topic echo .

However, this logic cannot avoid a vehicle that has broken down and is stopped in the center of the lane, which should be recognized as a static object by the perception module. There is room for improvement in the performance of this decision. Resampling path Now the rough resolution resampling is processed to the output path in order to reduce the computational cost for the later modules. This resolution is set to a uniformly large value \u3000(e.g. 5m ), but small resolution should be applied for complex paths.","title":"Future extensions / Unimplemented parts"},{"location":"planning/behavior_path_planner/behavior_path_planner_avoidance-design/#how-to-debug","text":"","title":"How to debug"},{"location":"planning/behavior_path_planner/behavior_path_planner_avoidance-design/#publishing-visualization-marker","text":"Developers can see what is going on in each process by visualizing all the avoidance planning process outputs.

Lane Change Requirement # During lane change request condition The ego-vehicle isn\u2019t on a preferred_lane . There is neither intersection nor crosswalk on the path of the lane change lane change ready condition Path of the lane change does not collide with other dynamic objects (see the figure below) Lane change candidate path is approved by an operator. Generating Lane Change Candidate Path # The lane change candidate path is divided into two phases: preparation and lane-changing. The following figure illustrates each phase of the lane change candidate path. Preparation phase # The preparation trajectory is the candidate path's first and the straight portion generated along the ego vehicle's current lane. The length of the preparation trajectory is computed as follows. lane_change_prepare_distance = max ( current_speed * lane_change_prepare_duration + 0.5 * deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration ^ 2 , minimum_lane_change_prepare_distance ) During the preparation phase, the turn signal will be activated when the remaining distance is equal to or less than lane_change_search_distance . Lane-changing phase # The lane-changing phase consist of the shifted path that moves ego from current lane to the target lane. Total distance of lane-changing phase is as follows. lane_change_prepare_velocity = current_speed + deceleration * lane_change_prepare_duration lane_changing_distance = max ( lane_change_prepare_velocity * lane_changing_duration + 0.5 * deceleration * lane_changing_duration ^ 2 , minimum_lane_change_length + backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane ) The backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane is added to allow some window for any possible delay, such as control or mechanical delay during brake lag. Multiple candidate path samples # Lane change velocity is affected by the ego vehicle's current velocity. High velocity requires longer preparation and lane changing distance. However we also need to plan lane changing trajectories in case ego vehicle slows down. Computing candidate paths that assumes ego vehicle's slows down is performed by substituting predetermined deceleration value into lane_change_prepare_distance , lane_change_prepare_velocity and lane_changing_distance equation. The predetermined deceleration are a set of value that starts from deceleration = 0.0 , and decrease by acceleration_resolution until it reaches deceleration = -maximum_deceleration . The acceleration_resolution is determine by the following acceleration_resolution = maximum_deceleration / lane_change_sampling_num The following figure illustrates when lane_change_sampling_num = 4 . Assuming that maximum_deceleration = 1.0 then a0 == 0.0 == no deceleration , a1 == 0.25 , a2 == 0.5 , a3 == 0.75 and a4 == 1.0 == maximum_deceleration . a0 is the expected lane change trajectories should ego vehicle do not decelerate, and a1 's path is the expected lane change trajectories should ego vehicle decelerate at 0.25 m/s^2 . Which path will be chosen will depend on validity and collision check. Candidate Path's validity check # A candidate path is valid if the total lane change distance is less than distance to the end of current lane distance to the next intersection distance from current pose to the goal. distance to the crosswalk. The goal must also be in the list of the preferred lane. The following flow chart illustrates the validity check. Candidate Path's Safety check # Valid candidate path is evaluated for safety before is was selected as the output candidate path. The flow of the process is as follows. If all valid candidate path is unsafe, then the operator will have the option to perform force lane change by using the front-most candidate path as the output. The force lane change will ignore all safety checks. A candidate path's is safe if it satisfies the following lateral distance criteria, lateral distance > lateral_distance_threshold However, suppose the lateral distance is insufficient. In that case, longitudinal distance will be evaluated. The candidate path is safe only when the longitudinal gap between the ego vehicle and the dynamic object is wide enough. The following charts illustrate the flow of the safety checks Calculating and evaluating longitudinal distance # A sufficient longitudinal gap between vehicles will prevent any rear-end collision from happening. This includes an emergency stop or sudden braking scenarios. The following information is required to evaluate the longitudinal distance between vehicles estimated speed of the dynamic objects predicted path of dynamic objects ego vehicle's current speed ego vehicle's predicted path (converted/estimated from candidate path) The following figure illustrates how the safety check is performed on ego vs. dynamic objects. Let v_front and a_front be the front vehicle's velocity and deceleration, respectively, and v_rear and a_rear be the rear vehicle's velocity and deceleration, respectively. Front vehicle and rear vehicle assignment will depend on which predicted path's pose is currently being evaluated. The following figure illustrates front and rear vehicle velocity assignment. Assuming the front vehicle brakes, then d_front is the distance the front vehicle will travel until it comes to a complete stop. The distance is computed from the equation of motion, which yield. d_front = - std :: pow ( v_front , 2 ) / ( 2 * a_front ) Using the same formula to evaluate the rear vehicle's stopping distance d_rear is insufficient. This is because as the rear vehicle's driver saw the front vehicle's sudden brake, it will take some time for the driver to process the information and react by pressing the brake. We call this delay the reaction time. The reaction time is considered from the duration starting from the driver seeing the front vehicle brake light until the brake is pressed. As the brake is pressed, the time margin (which might be caused by mechanical or control delay) also needs to be considered. With these two parameters included, the formula for d_rear will be as follows. d_rear = v_rear * rear_vehicle_reaction_time + v_rear * rear_vehicle_safety_time_margin + ( - std :: pow ( v_front , 2 ) / 2 * a_rear ) Since there is no absolute value for the deceleration a_front and a_rear , both of the values are parameterized ( expected_front_deceleration and expected_rear_deceleration , respectively) with the estimation of how much deceleration will occur if the brake is pressed. The longitudinal distance is evaluated as follows d_rear < d_front + d_inter where d_inter is the relative longitudinal distance obtained at each evaluated predicted pose. Finally minimum longitudinal distance for d_rear is added to compensate for object to near to each other when d_rear = 0.0 . This yields std :: max ( longitudinal_distance_min_threshold , d_rear ) < d_front + d_inter Collision check in prepare phase # The ego vehicle may need to secure ample inter-vehicle distance ahead of the target vehicle before attempting a lane change. The flag enable_collision_check_at_prepare_phase can be enabled to gain this behavior. The following image illustrates the differences between the false and true cases. The parameter prepare_phase_ignore_target_speed_thresh can be configured to ignore the prepare phase collision check for targets whose speeds are less than a specific threshold, such as stationary or very slow-moving objects. If the lane is blocked and multiple lane changes # When driving on the public road with other vehicles, there exist scenarios where lane changes cannot be executed. Suppose the candidate path is evaluated as unsafe, for example, due to incoming vehicles in the adjacent lane. In that case, the ego vehicle can't change lanes, and it is impossible to reach the goal. Therefore, the ego vehicle must stop earlier at a certain distance and wait for the adjacent lane to be evaluated as safe. The minimum stopping distance computation is as follows. minimum_lane_change_distance = num_of_lane_changes * ( minimum_lane_change_length + backward_length_buffer_for_end_of_lane ) The following figure illustrates when the lane is blocked in multiple lane changes cases. Intersection # Lane change in the intersection is prohibited following traffic regulation. Therefore, if the goal is place close passed the intersection, the lane change needs to be completed before ego vehicle enters the intersection region. Similar to the lane blocked case, in case of the path is unsafe, ego vehicle will stop and waits for the dynamic object to pass by. The following figure illustrate the intersection case. Abort lane change # The lane changing process can still be aborted if the proper conditions are satisfied. The following states are validated before the abort request is approved. Ego's current speed is under the threshold, and ego is still in the current lane ego relative distance from the centerline and ego relative yaw from lanelet's orientation is under the threshold.

There are also optional flags that enables the pass/stop decision for motorcycle and unknown objects. pedestrian bicycle Parameter Type Description crosswalk_attention_range double [m] the detection area is defined as -X meters before the crosswalk to +X meters behind the crosswalk target/unknown bool whether to look and stop by UNKNOWN objects target/bicycle bool whether to look and stop by BICYCLE objects target/motorcycle bool whether to look and stop MOTORCYCLE objects target/pedestrian bool whether to look and stop PEDESTRIAN objects Inner-workings / Algorithms # Stop position # The stop position is determined by the existence of the stop line defined by the HDMap, the positional relationship between the stop line and the pedestrians and bicycles, and each parameter. Pass judge logic # At first, this module determines whether the pedestrians or bicycles are likely to cross the crosswalk based on the color of the pedestrian traffic light signal related to the crosswalk. Only when the pedestrian traffic signal is RED , this module judges that the objects will not cross the crosswalk and skip the pass judge logic. Secondly, this module makes a decision as to whether ego should stop in front of the crosswalk or pass through based on the relative relationship between TTC(Time-To-Collision) and TTV(Time-To-Vehicle). The TTC is the time it takes for ego to reach the virtual collision point, and the TTV is the time it takes for the object to reach the virtual collision point. virtual collision point Depending on the relative relationship between TTC and TTV, the ego's behavior at crosswalks can be classified into three categories. TTC >> TTV : The objects have enough time to cross first before ego reaches the crosswalk. (Type-A) TTC \u2252 TTV : There is a risk of a near miss and collision between ego and objects at the virtual collision point. (Type-B) TTC << TTV : Ego has enough time to path through the crosswalk before the objects reach the virtual collision point. (Type-C) This module judges that ego is able to pass through the crosswalk without collision risk when the relative relationship between TTC and TTV is Type-A and Type-C . On the other hand, this module judges that ego needs to stop in front of the crosswalk prevent collision with objects in Type-B condition. The time margin can be set by parameters ego_pass_first_margin and ego_pass_later_margin . This logic is designed based on [1]. time-to-collision vs time-to-vehicle This module uses the larger value of estimated object velocity and min_object_velocity in calculating TTV in order to avoid division by zero. Dead lock prevention # If there are objects stop within a radius of min_object_velocity * ego_pass_later_margin meters from virtual collision point, this module judges that ego should stop based on the pass judge logic described above at all times. In such a situation, even if the pedestrian has no intention of crossing, ego continues the stop decision on the spot. So, this module has another logic for dead lock prevention, and if the object continues to stop for more than max_yield_timeout seconds after ego stops in front of the crosswalk, this module judges that the object has no intention of crossing and switches from STOP state to PASS state. The parameter stop_object_velocity_threshold is used to judge whether the objects are stopped or not. In addition, if the object starts to move after the module judges that the object has no intention of crossing, this module judges whether ego should stop or not once again. dead lock situation Safety Slow Down Behavior # In current autoware implementation if there are no target objects around a crosswalk, ego vehicle will not slow down for the crosswalk. However, if ego vehicle to slow down to a certain speed in such cases is wanted then it is possible by adding some tags to the related crosswalk definition as it is instructed in lanelet2_format_extension.md document.

This module is designed for rule-based intersection velocity decision that is easy for developers to design its behavior. It generates proper velocity for intersection scene. In addition, the external users / modules (e.g. remote operation) to can intervene the STOP/GO decision for the vehicle behavior. The override interface is expected to be used, for example, for remote intervention in emergency situations or gathering information on operator decisions during development. Activation Timing # This function is activated when the attention lane conflicts with the ego vehicle's lane. Limitations # This module allows developers to design vehicle velocity in intersection module using specific rules. This module is affected by object detection and prediction accuracy considering as stuck vehicle in this intersection module. Inner-workings / Algorithms # How To Select Attention Target Objects # Objects that satisfy all of the following conditions are considered as target objects (possible collision objects): The type of object type is car , truck , bus or motorbike . (Bicycle, pedestrian, animal, unknown are not.) The center of gravity of object is located within a certain distance from the attention lane (threshold = detection_area_margin ) . (Optional condition) The center of gravity is in the intersection area . To deal with objects that is in the area not covered by the lanelets in the intersection. The posture of object is the same direction as the attention lane (threshold = detection_area_angle_threshold ). The orientation of the target is recalculated in this module according to the orientation_reliable and the sign of the velocity of the target. Not being in the neighboring lanes of the ego vehicle . neighboring lanes include the ego lane of the vehicle and the adjacent lanes of it with turn_direction as the ego lane. How to Define Attention Lanes # Target objects are limited by lanelets to prevent unexpected behavior. A lane that satisfies the following conditions is defined as an \"Attention Lane\" and used to define the target object. The lane crosses with the driving lane of the ego-vehicle The lane has high priority for the driving lane of the ego-vehicle (priority tags are needed to be configured in Lanelet-map according to the situation). See the following figures to know how to create an attention area and its rationale. Note: the case traffic light, turn right only is not currently implemented. Collision Check and Crossing Judgement # The following process is performed for the attention targets to determine whether the ego vehicle can cross the intersection safely. If it is judged that the ego vehicle cannot pass through the intersection with enough margin, it will insert the stopping speed on the stop line of the intersection. calculate the passing time and the time that the ego vehicle is in the intersection. This time is set as t_s t_s ~ t_e t_e extract the predicted path of the target object whose confidence is greater than min_predicted_path_confidence . detect collision between the extracted predicted path and ego's predicted path in the following process. obtain the passing area of the ego vehicle A_{ego} A_{ego} in t_s t_s ~ t_e t_e . calculate the passing area of the target object A_{target} A_{target} at t_s t_s - collision_start_margin_time ~ t_e t_e + collision_end_margin_time for each predicted path (*1). check if A_{ego} A_{ego} and A_{target} A_{target} regions are overlapped (has collision). when a collision is detected, the module inserts a stop velocity in front of the intersection. Note that there is a time margin for the stop release (*2). If ego is over the pass_judge_line , collision checking is not processed to avoid sudden braking. However if ego velocity is lower than the threshold keep_detection_vel_thr then this module continues collision checking. (*1) The parameters collision_start_margin_time and collision_end_margin_time can be interpreted as follows: If the ego vehicle passes through the intersection earlier than the target object, the collision is detected if the time difference between the two is less than collision_start_margin_time . If the ego vehicle passes through the intersection later than the target object, the collision is detected if the time difference between the two is less than collision_end_margin_time . (*2) If the collision is detected, the state transits to \"stop\" immediately. On the other hand, the collision judgment must be clear for a certain period (default : 2.0[s]) to transit from \"stop\" to \"go\" to prevent to prevent chattering of decisions. Stop Line Automatic Generation # The driving lane is complemented at a certain intervals (default : 20 [cm]), and the line which is a margin distance (default : 100cm) in front of the attention lane is defined as a stop line. (Also the length of the vehicle is considered and the stop point is set at the base_link point in front of the stop lane.) Pass Judge Line # To avoid a rapid braking, in case that a deceleration more than a threshold (default : 0.5[G]) is needed, the ego vehicle doesn\u2019t stop. In order to judge this condition, pass judge line is set a certain distance (default : 0.5 * v_current^2 / a_max) in front of the stop line. To prevent a chattering, once the ego vehicle passes this line, \u201cstop\u201d decision in the intersection won\u2019t be done any more. To prevent going over the pass judge line before the traffic light stop line, the distance between stop line and pass judge line become 0m in case that there is a stop line between the ego vehicle and an intersection stop line. Stuck Vehicle Detection # If there is any object in a certain distance (default : 5[m]) from the end point of the intersection lane on the driving lane and the object velocity is less than a threshold (default 3.0[km/h]), the object is regarded as a stuck vehicle. If the stuck vehicle exists, the ego vehicle cannot enter the intersection. As a related case, if the object in front of the ego vehicle is turning the same direction, this module predicts the stopping point that the object will reach at a certain deceleration (default: -1.0[m/s^2]). If the predicted position is in stuck vehicle detection area AND the position which vehicle length [m] behind the predicted position is in detection area, the ego vehicle will also stop.

Change state_transit_margin_time to lower value. Be careful if this margin is too small then vehicle is going to change state many times and cause chattering. The distance to stuck vehicle is too long. Change stuck_vehicle_detect_dist to lower value. Note this module consider obstacle stop max distance as detection distance. The speed in intersection is too slow Change intersection_velocity to higher value. Flowchart # NOTE current state is treated as STOP if is_entry_prohibited = true else GO Known Limits # This module generate intersection stop line and ignoring lanelet automatically form lanelet map , however if you want to set intersection stop line and ignoring lanelet manually you need to tag right_of_way and yield to all conflicting lanes properly. How to Set Lanelet Map fot Intersection # Set a turn_direction tag (Fig. 1) # IntersectionModule will be activated by this tag. If this tag is not set, ego-vehicle don\u2019t recognize the lane as an intersection. Even if it\u2019s a straight lane, this tag is mandatory if it is located within intersection. Set a value in turn_direction tag to light up turn signals. Values of turn_direction must be one of \u201cstraight\u201d(no turn signal), \u201cright\u201d or \u201cleft\u201d. Autoware will light up respective turn signals 30[m] before entering the specified lane. You may also set optional tag \u201cturn_signal_distance\u201d to modify the distance to start lighting up turn signals. Lanes within intersections must be defined as a single Lanelet. For example, blue lane in Fig.3 cannot be split into 2 Lanelets. Explicitly describe a stop position [RoadMarking] (Optional) (Fig. 2) # As a default, IntersectionModule estimates a stop position by the crossing point of driving lane and attention lane. But there are some cases like Fig.2 in which we would like to set a stop position explicitly. When a stop_line is defined as a RoadMarking item in the intersection lane, it overwrites the stop position. (Not only creating stop_line , but also defining as a RoadMaking item are needed.) Exclusion setting of attention lanes [RightOfWay] (Fig.3) # By default, IntersectionModule treats all lanes crossing with the registered lane as attention targets (yellow and green lanelets). But in some cases (e.g. when driving lane is priority lane or traffic light is green for the driving lane), we want to ignore some of the yield lanes. By setting RightOfWay of the RegulatoryElement item, we can define lanes to be ignored. Register ignored lanes as \u201cyield\u201d and register the attention lanes and driving lane as \u201cright_of_way\u201d lanelets in RightOfWay RegulatoryElement (For an intersection with traffic lights, we need to create items for each lane in the intersection.

Name Type Description pose geometry_msgs::msg::Pose pose of the obstacle classifications std::vector<autoware_auto_perception_msgs::msg::ObjectClassification> classifications with probability shape autoware_auto_perception_msgs::msg::Shape shape of the obstacle predicted_paths std::vector<DynamicObstacle::PredictedPath> predicted paths with confidence. this data doesn't have time step because we use minimum and maximum velocity instead. min_velocity_mps float minimum velocity of the obstacle. specified by parameter of dynamic_obstacle.min_vel_kmph max_velocity_mps float maximum velocity of the obstacle. specified by parameter of dynamic_obstacle.max_vel_kmph Enter the maximum/minimum velocity of the object as a parameter, adding enough margin to the expected velocity. This parameter is used to create polygons for collision detection . Future work: Determine the maximum/minimum velocity from the estimated velocity with covariance of the object 3 types of detection method # We have 3 types of detection method to meet different safety and availability requirements. The characteristics of them are shown in the table below. Method of Object has high availability (less false positive) because it detects only objects whose predicted path is on the lane. However, sometimes it is not safe because perception may fail to detect obstacles or generate incorrect predicted paths. On the other hand, method of Points has high safety (less false negative) because it uses pointcloud as input. Since points don't have a predicted path, the path that moves in the direction normal to the path of ego vehicle is considered to be the predicted path of abstracted dynamic obstacle data. However, without proper adjustment of filter of points, it may detect a lot of points and it will result in very low availability. Method of ObjectWithoutPath has the characteristics of an intermediate of Object and Points . Method Description Object use an object with the predicted path for collision detection. ObjectWithoutPath use an object but not use the predicted path for collision detection. replace the path assuming that an object jumps out to the lane at specified velocity. Points use filtered points for collision detection. the path is created assuming that points jump out to the lane. points are regarded as an small circular shaped obstacle. Exclude obstacles outside of partition # This module can exclude the obstacles outside of partition such as guardrail, fence, and wall. We need lanelet map that has the information of partition to use this feature. By this feature, we can reduce unnecessary deceleration by obstacles that are unlikely to jump out to the lane. You can choose whether to use this feature by parameter of use_partition_lanelet . Collision detection # Detect collision with dynamic obstacles # Along the ego vehicle path, determine the points where collision detection is to be performed for each detection_span . The travel times to the each points are calculated from the expected target velocity . For the each points, collision detection is performed using the footprint polygon of the ego vehicle and the polygon of the predicted location of the obstacles. The predicted location of the obstacles is described as rectangle or polygon that has the range calculated by min velocity, max velocity and the ego vehicle's travel time to the point. If the input type of the dynamic obstacle is Points , the obstacle shape is defined as a small cylinder. Multiple points are detected as collision points because collision detection is calculated between two polygons. So we select the point that is on the same side as the obstacle and close to ego vehicle as the collision point. Insert velocity # Insert velocity to decelerate for obstacles # If the collision is detected, stop point is inserted on distance of base link to front + stop margin from the selected collision point. The base link to front means the distance between base_link (center of rear-wheel axis) and front of the car. Stop margin is determined by the parameter of stop_margin . Insert velocity to approach the obstacles # If you select the method of Points or ObjectWithoutPath , sometimes ego keeps stopping in front of the obstacle. To avoid this problem, This feature has option to approach the obstacle with slow velocity after stopping. If the parameter of approaching.enable is set to true, ego will approach the obstacle after ego stopped for state.stop_time_thresh seconds. The maximum velocity of approaching can be specified by the parameter of approaching.limit_vel_kmph . The decision to approach the obstacle is determined by a simple state transition as following image. Limit velocity with specified jerk and acc limit # The maximum slowdown velocity is calculated in order not to slowdown too much. See the Occlusion Spot document for more details.

This module plans a velocity profile within the limitations of the velocity, the acceleration and the jerk to realize both the maximization of velocity and the ride quality. We call this module motion_velocity_smoother because the limitations of the acceleration and the jerk means the smoothness of the velocity profile. Inner-workings / Algorithms # Flow chart # Extract trajectory # For the point on the reference trajectory closest to the center of the rear wheel axle of the vehicle, it extracts the reference path between extract_behind_dist behind and extract_ahead_dist ahead. Apply external velocity limit # It applies the velocity limit input from the external of motion_velocity_smoother . Remark that the external velocity limit is different from the velocity limit already set on the map and the reference trajectory. The external velocity is applied at the position that it is able to reach the velocity limit with the deceleration and the jerk constraints set as the parameter. Apply stop approaching velocity # It applies the velocity limit near the stopping point. This function is used to approach near the obstacle or improve the accuracy of stopping. Apply lateral acceleration limit # It applies the velocity limit to decelerate at the curve. It calculates the velocity limit from the curvature of the reference trajectory and the maximum lateral acceleration max_lateral_accel . The velocity limit is set as not to fall under min_curve_velocity . Note: velocity limit that requests larger than nominal.jerk is not applied. In other words, even if a sharp curve is planned just in front of the ego, no deceleration is performed. Apply steering rate limit # It calculates the desired steering angles of trajectory points. and it applies the steering rate limit. If the ( steering_angle_rate > max_steering_angle_rate ), it decreases the velocity of the trajectory point to acceptable velocity. Resample trajectory # It resamples the points on the reference trajectory with designated time interval. Note that the range of the length of the trajectory is set between min_trajectory_length and max_trajectory_length , and the distance between two points is longer than min_trajectory_interval_distance . It samples densely up to the distance traveled between resample_time with the current velocity, then samples sparsely after that. By sampling according to the velocity, both calculation load and accuracy are achieved since it samples finely at low velocity and coarsely at high velocity. Calculate initial state # Calculate initial values for velocity planning. The initial values are calculated according to the situation as shown in the following table. Situation Initial velocity Initial acceleration First calculation Current velocity 0.0 Engaging engage_velocity engage_acceleration Deviate between the planned velocity and the current velocity Current velocity Previous planned value Normal Previous planned value Previous planned value Smooth velocity # It plans the velocity. The algorithm of velocity planning is chosen from JerkFiltered , L2 and Linf , and it is set in the launch file. In these algorithms, they use OSQP[1] as the solver of the optimization. JerkFiltered # It minimizes the sum of the minus of the square of the velocity and the square of the violation of the velocity limit, the acceleration limit and the jerk limit. L2 # It minimizes the sum of the minus of the square of the velocity, the square of the the pseudo-jerk[2] and the square of the violation of the velocity limit and the acceleration limit. Linf # It minimizes the sum of the minus of the square of the velocity, the maximum absolute value of the the pseudo-jerk[2] and the square of the violation of the velocity limit and the acceleration limit. Post process # It performs the post-process of the planned velocity. Set zero velocity ahead of the stopping point Set maximum velocity given in the config named max_velocity Set velocity behind the current pose Resample trajectory ( post resampling ) Output debug data After the optimization, a resampling called post resampling is performed before passing the optimized trajectory to the next node. Since the required path interval from optimization may be different from the one for the next module, post resampling helps to fill this gap. Therefore, in post resampling , it is necessary to check the path specification of the following module to determine the parameters. Note that if the computational load of the optimization algorithm is high and the path interval is sparser than the path specification of the following module in the first resampling, post resampling would resample the trajectory densely. On the other hand, if the computational load of the optimization algorithm is small and the path interval is denser than the path specification of the following module in the first resampling, the path is sparsely resampled according to the specification of the following module.

Otherwise, previously generated (optimized) trajectory is published just with aligning the velocity from the latest behavior path. Ego moves a certain distance compared to the previous ego pose (default: 3.0 [m]) Time passes (default: 1.0 [s]) Ego is far from the previously generated trajectory getRoadClearanceMap # Cost map is generated according to the distance to the road boundaries. These cost maps are used in the optimization to generate a collision-free trajectory. drawObstacleOnImage # Only obstacles that are static and locate in a shoulder lane is decided to avoid. In detail, this equals to the following three conditions at the same time, and the red obstacles in the figure (id: 3, 4, 5) is to be avoided. Velocity is under a certain value (default: 0.1 [m/s]) CoG of the obstacles is not on the center line so that the ego will not avoid the car in front of the ego in the same lane. At least one point of the obstacle polygon is outside the drivable area. getObstacleClearanceMap # Cost map is generated according to the distance to the target obstacles to be avoided. getEBTrajectory # The latter optimization (MPT) assumes that the reference path is smooth enough. Therefore the path from behavior is made smooth here, and send to the optimization as a format of trajectory. Obstacles are ignored in this function. More details can be seen in the Elastic Band section. getModelPredictiveTrajectory # This module makes the trajectory kinematically-feasible and collision-free. We define vehicle pose in the frenet coordinate, and minimize tracking errors by optimization. This optimization considers vehicle kinematics and collision checking with road boundary and obstacles. To decrease the computation cost, the optimization is applied to the shorter trajectory (default: 50 [m]) than the whole trajectory, and concatenate the remained trajectory with the optimized one at last. The trajectory just in front of the ego must not be changed a lot so that the steering wheel will be stable. Therefore, we use the previously generated trajectory in front of the ego. Optimization center on the vehicle, that tries to locate just on the trajectory, can be tuned along side the vehicle vertical axis. This parameter mpt.kinematics.optimization center offset is defined as the signed length from the back-wheel center to the optimization center. Some examples are shown in the following figure, and it is shown that the trajectory of vehicle shape differs according to the optimization center even if the reference trajectory (green one) is the same. More details can be seen in the Model Predictive Trajectory section. insertZeroVelocityOutsideDrivableArea # Optimized trajectory is too short for velocity planning, therefore extend the trajectory by concatenating the optimized trajectory and the behavior path considering drivability. Generated trajectory is checked if it is inside the drivable area or not, and if outside drivable area, output a trajectory inside drivable area with the behavior path or the previously generated trajectory. As described above, the behavior path is separated into two paths: one is for optimization and the other is the remain. The first path becomes optimized trajectory, and the second path just is transformed to a trajectory. Then a trajectory inside the drivable area is calculated as follows. If optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area , and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, the output trajectory will be just concatenation of those two trajectories. In this case, we do not care if the remained trajectory is inside or outside the drivable area since generally it is outside the drivable area (especially in a narrow road), but we want to pass a trajectory as long as possible to the latter module. If optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area , and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, and if the previously generated trajectory is memorized , the output trajectory will be the previously generated trajectory, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area. and if the previously generated trajectory is not memorized , the output trajectory will be a part of trajectory just transformed from the behavior path, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area. Optimization failure is dealt with the same as if the optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area. The output trajectory is memorized as a previously generated trajectory for the next cycle. Rationale In the current design, since there are some modelling errors, the constraints are considered to be soft constraints. Therefore, we have to make sure that the optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area or not after optimization. alignVelocity # Velocity is assigned in the result trajectory from the velocity in the behavior path. The shapes of the trajectory and the path are different, therefore the each nearest trajectory point to the path is searched and interpolated linearly. Algorithms # In this section, Elastic band (to make the path smooth) and Model Predictive Trajectory (to make the trajectory kinematically feasible and collision-free) will be explained in detail. Elastic band # Abstract # Elastic band smooths the path generated in the behavior. Since the latter process of optimization uses the curvature and normal vector of the reference path, smoothing should be applied here so that the optimization will be stable. This smoothing process does not consider collision. Therefore the output path may have a collision with road boundaries or obstacles. Formulation # We formulate a QP problem minimizing the distance between the previous point and the next point for each point. Conditions that each point can move to a certain extent are used so that the path will not changed a lot but will be smoother. For k k 'th point ( \\boldsymbol{p}_k = (x_k, y_k) \\boldsymbol{p}_k = (x_k, y_k) ), the objective function is as follows. The beginning and end point are fixed during the optimization. \\begin{align} \\ J & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} ||(\\boldsymbol{p}_{k+1} - \\boldsymbol{p}_{k}) - (\\boldsymbol{p}_{k} - \\boldsymbol{p}_{k-1})||^2 \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} ||\\boldsymbol{p}_{k+1} - 2 \\boldsymbol{p}_{k} + \\boldsymbol{p}_{k-1}||^2 \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\{(x_{k+1} - x_k + x_{k-1})^2 + (y_{k+1} - y_k + y_{k-1})^2\\} \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\begin{pmatrix} \\ x_0 \\\\ \\ x_1 \\\\ \\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ x_{n-2}\\\\ \\ x_{n-1} \\\\ \\ x_{n} \\\\ \\ y_0 \\\\ \\ y_1 \\\\ \\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ y_{n-2}\\\\ \\ y_{n-1} \\\\ \\ y_{n} \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}^T \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots& \\\\ -2 & 5 & -4 & 1 & 0 &\\dots \\\\ 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & \\\\ 0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & \\\\ \\vdots & 0 & \\ddots&\\ddots& \\ddots \\\\ & \\vdots & & & \\\\ & & & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\\\ & & & & 1 & -4 & 5 & -2 \\\\ & & & & & 1 & -2 & 1& \\\\ & & & & & & & &1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots& \\\\ & & & & & & & &-2 & 5 & -4 & 1 & 0 &\\dots \\\\ & & & & & & & &1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & \\\\ & & & & & & & &0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & \\\\ & & & & & & & &\\vdots & 0 & \\ddots&\\ddots& \\ddots \\\\ & & & & & & & & & \\vdots & & & \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -4 & 5 & -2 \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -2 & 1& \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\ x_0 \\\\ \\ x_1 \\\\ \\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ x_{n-2}\\\\ \\ x_{n-1} \\\\ \\ x_{n} \\\\ \\ y_0 \\\\ \\ y_1 \\\\ \\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ y_{n-2}\\\\ \\ y_{n-1} \\\\ \\ y_{n} \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\ J & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} ||(\\boldsymbol{p}_{k+1} - \\boldsymbol{p}_{k}) - (\\boldsymbol{p}_{k} - \\boldsymbol{p}_{k-1})||^2 \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} ||\\boldsymbol{p}_{k+1} - 2 \\boldsymbol{p}_{k} + \\boldsymbol{p}_{k-1}||^2 \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\{(x_{k+1} - x_k + x_{k-1})^2 + (y_{k+1} - y_k + y_{k-1})^2\\} \\\\ \\ & = \\min \\begin{pmatrix} \\ x_0 \\\\ \\ x_1 \\\\ \\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ x_{n-2}\\\\ \\ x_{n-1} \\\\ \\ x_{n} \\\\ \\ y_0 \\\\ \\ y_1 \\\\ \\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ y_{n-2}\\\\ \\ y_{n-1} \\\\ \\ y_{n} \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}^T \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots& \\\\ -2 & 5 & -4 & 1 & 0 &\\dots \\\\ 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & \\\\ 0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & \\\\ \\vdots & 0 & \\ddots&\\ddots& \\ddots \\\\ & \\vdots & & & \\\\ & & & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\\\ & & & & 1 & -4 & 5 & -2 \\\\ & & & & & 1 & -2 & 1& \\\\ & & & & & & & &1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & \\dots& \\\\ & & & & & & & &-2 & 5 & -4 & 1 & 0 &\\dots \\\\ & & & & & & & &1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 & \\\\ & & & & & & & &0 & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & \\\\ & & & & & & & &\\vdots & 0 & \\ddots&\\ddots& \\ddots \\\\ & & & & & & & & & \\vdots & & & \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -4 & 6 & -4 & 1 \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -4 & 5 & -2 \\\\ & & & & & & & & & & & & & 1 & -2 & 1& \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\ x_0 \\\\ \\ x_1 \\\\ \\ x_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ x_{n-2}\\\\ \\ x_{n-1} \\\\ \\ x_{n} \\\\ \\ y_0 \\\\ \\ y_1 \\\\ \\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\ y_{n-2}\\\\ \\ y_{n-1} \\\\ \\ y_{n} \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align} Model predictive trajectory # Abstract # Model Predictive Trajectory (MPT) calculates the trajectory that realizes the following conditions. Kinematically feasible for linear vehicle kinematics model Collision free with obstacles and road boundaries Conditions for collision free is considered to be not hard constraints but soft constraints. When the optimization failed or the optimized trajectory is not collision free, the output trajectory will be previously generated trajectory. Trajectory near the ego must be stable, therefore the condition where trajectory points near the ego are the same as previously generated trajectory is considered, and this is the only hard constraints in MPT. Vehicle kinematics # As the following figure, we consider the bicycle kinematics model in the frenet frame to track the reference path. At time step k k , we define lateral distance to the reference path, heading angle against the reference path, and steer angle as y_k y_k , \\theta_k \\theta_k , and \\delta_k \\delta_k respectively. Assuming that the commanded steer angle is \\delta_{des, k} \\delta_{des, k} , the kinematics model in the frenet frame is formulated as follows. We also assume that the steer angle \\delta_k \\delta_k is first-order lag to the commanded one. \\begin{align} y_{k+1} & = y_{k} + v \\sin \\theta_k dt \\\\ \\theta_{k+1} & = \\theta_k + \\frac{v \\tan \\delta_k}{L}dt - \\kappa_k v \\cos \\theta_k dt \\\\ \\delta_{k+1} & = \\delta_k - \\frac{\\delta_k - \\delta_{des,k}}{\\tau}dt \\end{align} \\begin{align} y_{k+1} & = y_{k} + v \\sin \\theta_k dt \\\\ \\theta_{k+1} & = \\theta_k + \\frac{v \\tan \\delta_k}{L}dt - \\kappa_k v \\cos \\theta_k dt \\\\ \\delta_{k+1} & = \\delta_k - \\frac{\\delta_k - \\delta_{des,k}}{\\tau}dt \\end{align} Linearization # Then we linearize these equations. y_k y_k and \\theta_k \\theta_k are tracking errors, so we assume that those are small enough. Therefore \\sin \\theta_k \\approx \\theta_k \\sin \\theta_k \\approx \\theta_k . Since \\delta_k \\delta_k is a steer angle, it is not always small. By using a reference steer angle \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} calculated by the reference path curvature \\kappa_k \\kappa_k , we express \\delta_k \\delta_k with a small value \\Delta \\delta_k \\Delta \\delta_k . Note that the steer angle \\delta_k \\delta_k is within the steer angle limitation \\delta_{\\max} \\delta_{\\max} . When the reference steer angle \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} is larger than the steer angle limitation \\delta_{\\max} \\delta_{\\max} , and \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} is used to linearize the steer angle, \\Delta \\delta_k \\Delta \\delta_k is \\Delta \\delta_k = \\delta - \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} = \\delta_{\\max} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\Delta \\delta_k = \\delta - \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} = \\delta_{\\max} - \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} , and the absolute \\Delta \\delta_k \\Delta \\delta_k gets larger. Therefore, we have to apply the steer angle limitation to \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} as well. \\begin{align} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} & = \\mathrm{clamp}(\\arctan(L \\kappa_k), -\\delta_{\\max}, \\delta_{\\max}) \\\\ \\delta_k & = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} + \\Delta \\delta_k, \\ \\Delta \\delta_k \\ll 1 \\\\ \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} & = \\mathrm{clamp}(\\arctan(L \\kappa_k), -\\delta_{\\max}, \\delta_{\\max}) \\\\ \\delta_k & = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} + \\Delta \\delta_k, \\ \\Delta \\delta_k \\ll 1 \\\\ \\end{align} \\mathrm{clamp}(v, v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}) \\mathrm{clamp}(v, v_{\\min}, v_{\\max}) is a function to convert v v to be larger than v_{\\min} v_{\\min} and smaller than v_{\\max} v_{\\max} . Using this \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} , \\tan \\delta_k \\tan \\delta_k is linearized as follows. \\begin{align} \\tan \\delta_k & \\approx \\tan \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} + \\left.\\frac{d \\tan \\delta}{d \\delta}\\right|_{\\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k}} \\Delta \\delta_k \\\\ & = \\tan \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} + \\left.\\frac{d \\tan \\delta}{d \\delta}\\right|_{\\delta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k}} (\\delta_{\\mathrm{ref}, k} -

Assuming that the lateral distance to the road boundaries or obstacles from the back wheel center, front wheel center, and the point between them are y_{\\mathrm{base}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{top}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} y_{\\mathrm{base}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{top}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} respectively, and slack variables for each point are \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}}, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}}, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}}, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}}, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}} , the soft constraints can be formulated as follows. y_{\\mathrm{base}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{base}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{base}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k}\\\\ y_{\\mathrm{top}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{top}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{top}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k}\\\\ y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} y_{\\mathrm{base}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{base}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{base}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k}\\\\ y_{\\mathrm{top}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{top}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{top}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k}\\\\ y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k, \\min} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} \\leq y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} (y_k) \\leq y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k, \\max} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\\\ 0 \\leq \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} Since y_{\\mathrm{base}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{top}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} y_{\\mathrm{base}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{top}, k}, y_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} is formulated as a linear function of y_k y_k , the objective function for soft constraints is formulated as follows. \\begin{align} J_2 & (\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}, \\boldsymbol {\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid})\\\\ & = w_{\\mathrm{base}} \\sum_{k} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} + w_{\\mathrm{mid}} \\sum_k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} + w_{\\mathrm{top}} \\sum_k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\end{align} \\begin{align} J_2 & (\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}, \\boldsymbol {\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid})\\\\ & = w_{\\mathrm{base}} \\sum_{k} \\lambda_{\\mathrm{base}, k} + w_{\\mathrm{mid}} \\sum_k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{mid}, k} + w_{\\mathrm{top}} \\sum_k \\lambda_{\\mathrm{top}, k} \\end{align} Slack variables are also design variables for optimization. We define a vector \\boldsymbol{v} \\boldsymbol{v} , that concatenates all the design variables. \\begin{align} \\boldsymbol{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}'^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid}^T \\end{pmatrix}^T \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\boldsymbol{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{u}'^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}^T & \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid}^T \\end{pmatrix}^T \\end{align} The summation of these two objective functions is the objective function for the optimization problem. \\begin{align} \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} J (\\boldsymbol{v}) = \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} J_1 (\\boldsymbol{u}') + J_2 (\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid}) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} J (\\boldsymbol{v}) = \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} J_1 (\\boldsymbol{u}') + J_2 (\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{base}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{top}, \\boldsymbol{\\lambda}_\\mathrm{mid}) \\end{align} As mentioned before, we use hard constraints where some trajectory points in front of the ego are the same as the previously generated trajectory points. This hard constraints is formulated as follows. \\begin{align} \\delta_k = \\delta_{k}^{\\mathrm{prev}} (0 \\leq i \\leq N_{\\mathrm{fix}}) \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\delta_k = \\delta_{k}^{\\mathrm{prev}} (0 \\leq i \\leq N_{\\mathrm{fix}}) \\end{align} Finally we transform those objective functions to the following QP problem, and solve it. \\begin{align} \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} \\ & \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{v}^T \\boldsymbol{H} \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{f} \\boldsymbol{v} \\\\ \\mathrm{s.t.} \\ & \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} \\leq \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{v} \\leq \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\min_{\\boldsymbol{v}} \\ & \\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{v}^T \\boldsymbol{H} \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{f} \\boldsymbol{v} \\\\ \\mathrm{s.t.} \\ & \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} \\leq \\boldsymbol{A} \\boldsymbol{v} \\leq \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} \\end{align} Constraints # Steer angle limitation # Steer angle has a certain limitation ( \\delta_{max} \\delta_{max} , \\delta_{min} \\delta_{min} ). Therefore we add linear inequality equations. \\begin{align} \\delta_{min} \\leq \\delta_i \\leq \\delta_{max} \\end{align} \\begin{align} \\delta_{min} \\leq \\delta_i \\leq \\delta_{max} \\end{align} Collision free # To realize collision-free path planning, we have to formulate constraints that the vehicle is inside the road (moreover, a certain meter far from the road boundary) and does not collide with obstacles in linear equations. For linearity, we chose a method to approximate the vehicle shape with a set of circles, that is reliable and easy to implement. Now we formulate the linear constraints where a set of circles on each trajectory point is collision-free. For collision checking, we have a drivable area in the format of an image where walls or obstacles are filled with a color. By using this drivable area, we calculate upper (left) and lower (right) boundaries along reference points so that we can interpolate boundaries on any position on the trajectory. Assuming that upper and lower boundaries are b_l b_l , b_u b_u respectively, and r r is a radius of a circle, lateral deviation of the circle center y' y' has to be b_l + r \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r. b_l + r \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r. Based on the following figure, y' y' can be formulated as follows. \\begin{align} y' & = L \\sin(\\theta + \\beta) + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & = L \\sin \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\cos \\theta \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & \\approx L \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\end{align} \\begin{align} y' & = L \\sin(\\theta + \\beta) + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & = L \\sin \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\cos \\theta \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & \\approx L \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\end{align} b_l + r - \\lambda \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r + \\lambda. b_l + r - \\lambda \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r + \\lambda. \\begin{align} y' & = C_1 \\boldsymbol{x} + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 (B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w}) + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} y' & = C_1 \\boldsymbol{x} + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 (B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w}) + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\end{align} Note that longitudinal position of the circle center and the trajectory point to calculate boundaries are different. But each boundaries are vertical against the trajectory, resulting in less distortion by the longitudinal position difference since road boundaries does not change so much. For example, if the boundaries are not vertical against the trajectory and there is a certain difference of longitudinal position between the circe center and the trajectory point, we can easily guess that there is much more distortion when comparing lateral deviation and boundaries. \\begin{align} A_{blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I_{N_{ref} \\times N_{ref}} & O \\dots & O\\\\ -C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O\\\\ O & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref} \\times D_v + N_{circle} N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower, blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} - C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} - C_2 \\\\ -\\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} + C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\\\ O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper, blk} & = \\boldsymbol{\\infty} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\end{align} \\begin{align} A_{blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I_{N_{ref} \\times N_{ref}} & O \\dots & O\\\\ -C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O\\\\ O & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref} \\times D_v + N_{circle} N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower, blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} - C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} - C_2 \\\\ -\\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} + C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\\\ O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper, blk} & = \\boldsymbol{\\infty} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\end{align} We will explain options for optimization.

N_{circle} N_{circle} is the number of circles to check collision. Tuning # Vehicle # max steering wheel degree mpt.kinematics.max_steer_deg Boundary search # advanced.mpt.bounds_search_widths In order to efficiently search precise lateral boundaries on each trajectory point, different resolutions of search widths are defined. By default, [0.45, 0.15, 0.05, 0.01] is used. In this case, the goal is to get the boundaries' length on each trajectory point with 0.01 [m] resolution. Firstly, lateral boundaries are searched with a rough resolution (= 0.45 [m]). Then, within its 0.45 [m] resolution which boundaries are inside, they are searched again with a bit precise resolution (= 0.15 [m]). Following this rule, finally boundaries with 0.01 [m] will be found. Assumptions # EB optimized trajectory length should be longer than MPT optimized trajectory length since MPT result may be jerky because of non-fixed reference path (= EB optimized trajectory) At least, EB fixed optimized trajectory length must be longer than MPT fixed optimization trajectory length This causes the case that there is a large difference between MPT fixed optimized point and MPT optimized point just after the point.

High computation cost Comparison to other methods # Planning a trajectory that satisfies kinematic feasibility and collision-free has two main characteristics that makes hard to be solved: one is non-convex and the other is high dimension. According to the characteristics, we investigate pros and cons of the typical planning methods: optimization-based, sampling-based, and learning-based method. Optimization-based method # pros: comparatively fast against high dimension by leveraging the gradient descent cons: often converge to the local minima in the non-convex problem Sampling-based method # pros: realize global optimization cons: high computation cost especially in the complex case Learning-based method # under research yet Based on these pros/cons, we chose the optimization-based planner first. Although it has a cons to converge to the local minima, it can get a good solution by the preprocessing to approximate the convex problem that almost equals to the original non-convex problem.

As described above, the behavior path is separated into two paths: one is for optimization and the other is the remain. The first path becomes optimized trajectory, and the second path just is transformed to a trajectory. Then a trajectory inside the drivable area is calculated as follows. If optimized trajectory is inside the drivable area , and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, the output trajectory will be just concatenation of those two trajectories. In this case, we do not care if the remained trajectory is inside or outside the drivable area since generally it is outside the drivable area (especially in a narrow road), but we want to pass a trajectory as long as possible to the latter module. If optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area , and the remained trajectory is inside/outside the drivable area, and if the previously generated trajectory is memorized , the output trajectory will be the previously generated trajectory, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area. and if the previously generated trajectory is not memorized , the output trajectory will be a part of trajectory just transformed from the behavior path, where zero velocity is inserted to the point firstly going outside the drivable area. Optimization failure is dealt with the same as if the optimized trajectory is outside the drivable area. The output trajectory is memorized as a previously generated trajectory for the next cycle.

For linearity, we chose a method to approximate the vehicle shape with a set of circles, that is reliable and easy to implement. Now we formulate the linear constraints where a set of circles on each trajectory point is collision-free. For collision checking, we have a drivable area in the format of an image where walls or obstacles are filled with a color. By using this drivable area, we calculate upper (left) and lower (right) boundaries along reference points so that we can interpolate boundaries on any position on the trajectory. Assuming that upper and lower boundaries are b_l b_l , b_u b_u respectively, and r r is a radius of a circle, lateral deviation of the circle center y' y' has to be b_l + r \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r. b_l + r \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r. Based on the following figure, y' y' can be formulated as follows. \\begin{align} y' & = L \\sin(\\theta + \\beta) + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & = L \\sin \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\cos \\theta \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & \\approx L \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\end{align} \\begin{align} y' & = L \\sin(\\theta + \\beta) + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & = L \\sin \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\cos \\theta \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\\\ & \\approx L \\theta \\cos \\beta + L \\sin \\beta + y \\cos \\beta - l \\sin(\\gamma - \\phi_a) \\end{align} b_l + r - \\lambda \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r + \\lambda. b_l + r - \\lambda \\leq y' \\leq b_u - r + \\lambda. \\begin{align} y' & = C_1 \\boldsymbol{x} + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 (B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w}) + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\end{align} \\begin{align} y' & = C_1 \\boldsymbol{x} + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 (B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w}) + C_2 \\\\ & = C_1 B \\boldsymbol{v} + \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\end{align} Note that longitudinal position of the circle center and the trajectory point to calculate boundaries are different. But each boundaries are vertical against the trajectory, resulting in less distortion by the longitudinal position difference since road boundaries does not change so much. For example, if the boundaries are not vertical against the trajectory and there is a certain difference of longitudinal position between the circe center and the trajectory point, we can easily guess that there is much more distortion when comparing lateral deviation and boundaries. \\begin{align} A_{blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I_{N_{ref} \\times N_{ref}} & O \\dots & O\\\\ -C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O\\\\ O & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref} \\times D_v + N_{circle} N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower, blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} - C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} - C_2 \\\\ -\\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} + C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\\\ O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper, blk} & = \\boldsymbol{\\infty} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\end{align} \\begin{align} A_{blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I_{N_{ref} \\times N_{ref}} & O \\dots & O\\\\ -C_1 B & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O\\\\ O & O & \\dots & O & I & O \\dots & O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref} \\times D_v + N_{circle} N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower, blk} & = \\begin{pmatrix} \\boldsymbol{b}_{lower} - C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} - C_2 \\\\ -\\boldsymbol{b}_{upper} + C_1 \\boldsymbol{w} + C_2 \\\\ O \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\\\ \\boldsymbol{b}_{upper, blk} & = \\boldsymbol{\\infty} \\in \\boldsymbol{R}^{3 N_{ref}} \\end{align} We will explain options for optimization.","title":"Collision free"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_avoidance_planner/#l-infinity-optimization","text":"The above formulation is called L2 norm for slack variables.

By default, objects that realize one of the following conditions are considered to be the target obstacle candidates. Some terms will be defined in the following subsections. Vehicle objects \"inside the detection area\" other than \"far crossing vehicles\". non vehicle objects \"inside the detection area\" \"Near cut-in vehicles\" outside the detection area Note that currently the obstacle candidates selection algorithm is for autonomous driving. However, we have following parameters as well for stop and cruise respectively so that we can extend the obstacles candidates selection algorithm for non vehicle robots. By default, unknown and vehicles are obstacles to cruise and stop, and non vehicles are obstacles just to stop. Parameter Type Description cruise_obstacle_type.unknown bool flag to consider unknown objects as being cruised cruise_obstacle_type.car bool flag to consider unknown objects as being cruised cruise_obstacle_type.truck bool flag to consider unknown objects as being cruised ... bool ... stop_obstacle_type.unknown bool flag to consider unknown objects as being stopped ... bool ... Inside the detection area # To calculate obstacles inside the detection area, firstly, obstacles whose distance to the trajectory is less than rough_detection_area_expand_width are selected. Then, the detection area, which is a trajectory with some lateral margin, is calculated as shown in the figure. The detection area width is a vehicle's width + detection_area_expand_width , and it is represented as a polygon resampled with decimate_trajectory_step_length longitudinally. The roughly selected obstacles inside the detection area are considered as inside the detection area. This two-step detection is used for calculation efficiency since collision checking of polygons is heavy. Boost.Geometry is used as a library to check collision among polygons. In the obstacle_filtering namespace, Parameter Type Description rough_detection_area_expand_width double rough lateral margin for rough detection area expansion [m] detection_area_expand_width double lateral margin for precise detection area expansion [m] decimate_trajectory_step_length double longitudinal step length to calculate trajectory polygon for collision checking [m] Far crossing vehicles # Near crossing vehicles (= not far crossing vehicles) are defined as vehicle objects realizing either of following conditions. whose yaw angle against the nearest trajectory point is greater than crossing_obstacle_traj_angle_threshold whose velocity is less than crossing_obstacle_velocity_threshold . Assuming t_1 to be the time for the ego to reach the current crossing obstacle position with the constant velocity motion, and t_2 to be the time for the crossing obstacle to go outside the detection area, if the following condition is realized, the crossing vehicle will be ignored. t_1 - t_2 > \\mathrm{margin\\_for\\_collision\\_time} t_1 - t_2 > \\mathrm{margin\\_for\\_collision\\_time} In the obstacle_filtering namespace, Parameter Type Description crossing_obstacle_velocity_threshold double velocity threshold to decide crossing obstacle [m/s] crossing_obstacle_traj_angle_threshold double yaw threshold of crossing obstacle against the nearest trajectory point [rad] collision_time_margin double time threshold of collision between obstacle and ego [s] Near Cut-in vehicles # Near Cut-in vehicles are defined as vehicle objects whose predicted path's footprints from the current time to max_prediction_time_for_collision_check overlap with the detection area longer than ego_obstacle_overlap_time_threshold . In the obstacle_filtering namespace, Parameter Type Description ego_obstacle_overlap_time_threshold double time threshold to decide cut-in obstacle for cruise or stop [s] max_prediction_time_for_collision_check double prediction time to check collision between obstacle and ego [s] outside_obstacle_min_velocity_threshold double minimum velocity threshold of target obstacle for cut-in detection [m/s] Stop planning # Parameter Type Description common.min_strong_accel double ego's minimum acceleration to stop [m/ss] common.safe_distance_margin double distance with obstacles for stop [m] common.terminal_safe_distance_margin double terminal_distance with obstacles for stop, which cannot be exceed safe distance margin [m] The role of the stop planning is keeping a safe distance with static vehicle objects or dynamic/static non vehicle objects. The stop planning just inserts the stop point in the trajectory to keep a distance with obstacles inside the detection area. The safe distance is parameterized as common.safe_distance_margin . When it stops at the end of the trajectory, and obstacle is on the same point, the safe distance becomes terminal_safe_distance_margin . When inserting the stop point, the required acceleration for the ego to stop in front of the stop point is calculated. If the acceleration is less than common.min_strong_accel , the stop planning will be cancelled since this package does not assume a strong sudden brake for emergency. Adaptive cruise planning # Parameter Type Description common.safe_distance_margin double minimum distance with obstacles for cruise [m] The role of the adaptive cruise planning is keeping a safe distance with dynamic vehicle objects with smoothed velocity transition. This includes not only cruising a front vehicle, but also reacting a cut-in and cut-out vehicle. The safe distance is calculated dynamically based on the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) by the following equation. d = v_{ego} t_{idling} + \\frac{1}{2} a_{ego} t_{idling}^2 + \\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 a_{ego}} - \\frac{v_{obstacle}^2}{2 a_{obstacle}}, d = v_{ego} t_{idling} + \\frac{1}{2} a_{ego} t_{idling}^2 + \\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 a_{ego}} - \\frac{v_{obstacle}^2}{2 a_{obstacle}}, assuming that d d is the calculated safe distance, t_{idling} t_{idling} is the idling time for the ego to detect the front vehicle's deceleration, v_{ego} v_{ego} is the ego's current velocity, v_{obstacle} v_{obstacle} is the front obstacle's current velocity, a_{ego} a_{ego} is the ego's acceleration, and a_{obstacle} a_{obstacle} is the obstacle's acceleration. These values are parameterized as follows. Other common values such as ego's minimum acceleration is defined in common.param.yaml . Parameter Type Description common.idling_time double idling time for the ego to detect the front vehicle starting deceleration [s] common.min_object_accel_for_rss double front obstacle's acceleration [m/ss] Implementation # Flowchart # Successive functions consist of obstacle_cruise_planner as follows. Various algorithms for stop and cruise planning will be implemented, and one of them is designated depending on the use cases. The core algorithm implementation generateTrajectory depends on the designated algorithm. Algorithm selection # Currently, only a PID-based planner is supported. Each planner will be explained in the following. Parameter Type Description common.planning_method string cruise and stop planning algorithm, selected from \"pid_base\" PID-based planner # Stop planning # In the pid_based_planner namespace, Parameter Type Description obstacle_velocity_threshold_from_cruise_to_stop double obstacle velocity threshold to be stopped from cruised [m/s] Only one obstacle is targeted for the stop planning. It is the obstacle among obstacle candidates whose velocity is less than obstacle_velocity_threshold_from_cruise_to_stop , and which is the nearest to the ego along the trajectory. A stop point is inserted keeping common.safe_distance_margin distance between the ego and obstacle. Note that, as explained in the stop planning design, a stop planning which requires a strong acceleration (less than common.min_strong_accel ) will be canceled. Adaptive cruise planning # In the pid_based_planner namespace, Parameter Type Description kp double p gain for pid control [-] ki double i gain for pid control [-] kd double d gain for pid control [-] output_ratio_during_accel double The output velocity will be multiplied by the ratio during acceleration to follow the front vehicle. [-] vel_to_acc_weight double target acceleration is target velocity * vel_to_acc_weight [-] min_cruise_target_vel double minimum target velocity during cruise [m/s] In order to keep the safe distance, the target velocity and acceleration is calculated and sent as an external velocity limit to the velocity smoothing package ( motion_velocity_smoother by default). The target velocity and acceleration is respectively calculated with the PID controller according to the error between the reference safe distance and the actual distance. Optimization-based planner # under construction Minor functions # Prioritization of behavior module's stop point # When stopping for a pedestrian walking on the crosswalk, the behavior module inserts the zero velocity in the trajectory in front of the crosswalk. Also obstacle_cruise_planner 's stop planning also works, and the ego may not reach the behavior module's stop point since the safe distance defined in obstacle_cruise_planner may be longer than the behavior module's safe distance. To resolve this non-alignment of the stop point between the behavior module and obstacle_cruise_planner , common.min_behavior_stop_margin is defined. In the case of the crosswalk described above, obstacle_cruise_planner inserts the stop point with a distance common.min_behavior_stop_margin at minimum between the ego and obstacle. Parameter Type Description common.min_behavior_stop_margin double minimum stop margin when stopping with the behavior module enabled [m] A function to keep the closest stop obstacle in target obstacles # In order to keep the closest stop obstacle in the target obstacles, we check whether it is disappeared or not from the target obstacles in the checkConsistency function. If the previous closest stop obstacle is remove from the lists, we keep it in the lists for stop_obstacle_hold_time_threshold seconds. Note that if a new stop obstacle appears and the previous closest obstacle removes from the lists, we do not add it to the target obstacles again. Parameter Type Description obstacle_filtering.stop_obstacle_hold_time_threshold double maximum time for holding closest stop obstacle [s] Visualization for debugging # Detection area # Green polygons which is a detection area is visualized by detection_polygons in the ~/debug/marker topic. Collision point # Red point which is a collision point with obstacle is visualized by collision_points in the ~/debug/marker topic. Obstacle for cruise # Yellow sphere which is a obstacle for cruise is visualized by obstacles_to_cruise in the ~/debug/marker topic. Obstacle for stop # Red sphere which is a obstacle for stop is visualized by obstacles_to_stop in the ~/debug/marker topic. Obstacle cruise wall # Yellow wall which means a safe distance to cruise if the ego's front meets the wall is visualized in the ~/debug/cruise_wall_marker topic. Obstacle stop wall # Red wall which means a safe distance to stop if the ego's front meets the wall is visualized in the ~/debug/stop_wall_marker topic. Known Limits # Common When the obstacle pose or velocity estimation has a delay, the ego sometimes will go close to the front vehicle keeping deceleration. Current implementation only uses predicted objects message for static/dynamic obstacles and does not use pointcloud. Therefore, if object recognition is lost, the ego cannot deal with the lost obstacle. The current predicted paths for obstacle's lane change does not have enough precision for obstacle_cruise_planner. Therefore, we set rough_detection_area a small value. PID-based planner The algorithm strongly depends on the velocity smoothing package ( motion_velocity_smoother by default) whether or not the ego realizes the designated target speed. If the velocity smoothing package is updated, please take care of the vehicle's behavior as much as possible.","title":"Obstacle Cruise Planner"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#obstacle-cruise-planner","text":"","title":"Obstacle Cruise Planner"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#overview","text":"The obstacle_cruise_planner package has following modules. obstacle stop planning inserting a stop point in the trajectory when there is a static obstacle on the trajectory. adaptive cruise planning sending an external velocity limit to motion_velocity_smoother when there is a dynamic obstacle to cruise on the trajectory","title":"Overview"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#interfaces","text":"","title":"Interfaces"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#input-topics","text":"Name Type Description ~/input/trajectory autoware_auto_planning_msgs::Trajectory input trajectory ~/input/smoothed_trajectory autoware_auto_planning_msgs::Trajectory trajectory with smoothed velocity ~/input/objects autoware_auto_perception_msgs::PredictedObjects dynamic objects ~/input/odometry nav_msgs::msg::Odometry ego odometry","title":"Input topics"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#output-topics","text":"Name Type Description ~output/trajectory autoware_auto_planning_msgs::Trajectory output trajectory ~output/velocity_limit tier4_planning_msgs::VelocityLimit velocity limit for cruising ~output/clear_velocity_limit tier4_planning_msgs::VelocityLimitClearCommand clear command for velocity limit ~output/stop_reasons tier4_planning_msgs::StopReasonArray reasons that make the vehicle to stop","title":"Output topics"},{"location":"planning/obstacle_cruise_planner/#design","text":"Design for the following functions is defined here.

(*2) The sources of velocity estimation can be changed by the following ROS parameters. adaptive_cruise_control.use_object_to_estimate_vel adaptive_cruise_control.use_pcl_to_estimate_vel This module works only when the target point is found in the detection area of the Obstacle stop planner module. The first process of this module is to estimate the velocity of the target vehicle point. The velocity estimation uses the velocity information of dynamic objects or the travel distance of the target vehicle point from the previous step. The dynamic object information is primal, and the travel distance estimation is used as a backup in case of the perception failure. If the target vehicle point is contained in the bounding box of a dynamic object geometrically, the velocity of the dynamic object is used as the target point velocity. Otherwise, the target point velocity is calculated by the travel distance of the target point from the previous step; that is (current_position - previous_position) / dt . Note that this travel distance based estimation fails when the target point is detected in the first time (it mainly happens in the cut-in situation). To improve the stability of the estimation, the median of the calculation result for several steps is used. If the calculated velocity is within the threshold range, it is used as the target point velocity. Only when the estimation is succeeded and the estimated velocity exceeds the value of obstacle_stop_velocity_thresh_* , the distance to the pointcloud from self-position is calculated. For prevent chattering in the mode transition, obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_start_acc is used for the threshold to start adaptive cruise, and obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_stop_acc is used for the threshold to stop adaptive cruise. When the calculated distance value exceeds the emergency distance d\\_{emergency} d\\_{emergency} calculated by emergency_stop parameters, target velocity to insert is calculated. The emergency distance d\\_{emergency} d\\_{emergency} is calculated as follows. d_{emergency} = d_{margin_{emergency}} + t_{idling_{emergency}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{emergency}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{emergency}}}) d_{emergency} = d_{margin_{emergency}} + t_{idling_{emergency}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{emergency}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{emergency}}}) d_{margin_{emergency}} d_{margin_{emergency}} is a minimum margin to the obstacle pointcloud. The value of d_{margin_{emergency}} d_{margin_{emergency}} depends on the parameter min_dist_stop t_{idling_{emergency}} t_{idling_{emergency}} is a supposed idling time. The value of t_{idling_{emergency}} t_{idling_{emergency}} depends on the parameter emergency_stop_idling_time v_{ego} v_{ego} is a current velocity of own vehicle a_{ego_{_{emergency}}} a_{ego_{_{emergency}}} is a minimum acceleration (maximum deceleration) of own vehicle.

The value of a_{obj_{_{emergency}}} a_{obj_{_{emergency}}} depends on the parameter obstacle_emergency_stop_acceleration *Above X_{_{emergency}} X_{_{emergency}} parameters are used only in emergency situation. The target velocity is determined to keep the distance to the obstacle pointcloud from own vehicle at the standard distance d\\_{standard} d\\_{standard} calculated as following. Therefore, if the distance to the obstacle pointcloud is longer than standard distance, The target velocity becomes higher than the current velocity, and vice versa. For keeping the distance, a PID controller is used. d_{standard} = d_{margin_{standard}} + t_{idling_{standard}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{standard}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{standard}}}) d_{standard} = d_{margin_{standard}} + t_{idling_{standard}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{standard}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{standard}}}) d_{margin_{standard}} d_{margin_{standard}} is a minimum margin to the obstacle pointcloud.

(*2) The sources of velocity estimation can be changed by the following ROS parameters. adaptive_cruise_control.use_object_to_estimate_vel adaptive_cruise_control.use_pcl_to_estimate_vel This module works only when the target point is found in the detection area of the Obstacle stop planner module. The first process of this module is to estimate the velocity of the target vehicle point. The velocity estimation uses the velocity information of dynamic objects or the travel distance of the target vehicle point from the previous step. The dynamic object information is primal, and the travel distance estimation is used as a backup in case of the perception failure. If the target vehicle point is contained in the bounding box of a dynamic object geometrically, the velocity of the dynamic object is used as the target point velocity. Otherwise, the target point velocity is calculated by the travel distance of the target point from the previous step; that is (current_position - previous_position) / dt . Note that this travel distance based estimation fails when the target point is detected in the first time (it mainly happens in the cut-in situation). To improve the stability of the estimation, the median of the calculation result for several steps is used. If the calculated velocity is within the threshold range, it is used as the target point velocity. Only when the estimation is succeeded and the estimated velocity exceeds the value of obstacle_stop_velocity_thresh_* , the distance to the pointcloud from self-position is calculated. For prevent chattering in the mode transition, obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_start_acc is used for the threshold to start adaptive cruise, and obstacle_velocity_thresh_to_stop_acc is used for the threshold to stop adaptive cruise. When the calculated distance value exceeds the emergency distance d\\_{emergency} d\\_{emergency} calculated by emergency_stop parameters, target velocity to insert is calculated. The emergency distance d\\_{emergency} d\\_{emergency} is calculated as follows. d_{emergency} = d_{margin_{emergency}} + t_{idling_{emergency}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{emergency}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{emergency}}}) d_{emergency} = d_{margin_{emergency}} + t_{idling_{emergency}} \\cdot v_{ego} + (-\\frac{v_{ego}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{ego_{emergency}}}) - (-\\frac{v_{obj}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{obj_{emergency}}}) d_{margin_{emergency}} d_{margin_{emergency}} is a minimum margin to the obstacle pointcloud.

For example, it allows to reduce the velocity when driving close to a guard rail in a curve. Without this node With this node Inner-workings / Algorithms # Using a parameter min_ttc (minimum time to collision), the node set velocity limits such that no collision with an obstacle would occur, even without new control inputs for a duration of min_ttc . To achieve this, the motion of the ego vehicle is simulated forward in time at each point of the trajectory to create a corresponding footprint. If the footprint collides with some obstacle, the velocity at the trajectory point is reduced such that the new simulated footprint do not have any collision. Simulated Motion, Footprint, and Collision Distance # The motion of the ego vehicle is simulated at each trajectory point using the heading , velocity , and steering defined at the point. Footprints are then constructed from these simulations and checked for collision. If a collision is found, the distance from the trajectory point is used to calculate the adjusted velocity that would produce a collision-free footprint. Parameter simulation.distance_method allow to switch between an exact distance calculation and a less expensive approximation using a simple euclidian distance. Two models can be selected with parameter simulation.model for simulating the motion of the vehicle: a simple particle model and a more complicated bicycle model. Particle Model # The particle model uses the constant heading and velocity of the vehicle at a trajectory point to simulate the future motion. The simulated forward motion corresponds to a straight line and the footprint to a rectangle. Footprint # The rectangle footprint is built from 2 lines parallel to the simulated forward motion and at a distance of half the vehicle width. Distance # When a collision point is found within the footprint, the distance is calculated as described in the following figure. Bicycle Model # The bicycle model uses the constant heading, velocity, and steering of the vehicle at a trajectory point to simulate the future motion. The simulated forward motion corresponds to an arc around the circle of curvature associated with the steering. Uncertainty in the steering can be introduced with the simulation.steering_offset parameter which will generate a range of motion from a left-most to a right-most steering. This results in 3 curved lines starting from the same trajectory point. A parameter simulation.nb_points is used to adjust the precision of these lines, with a minimum of 2 resulting in straight lines and higher values increasing the precision of the curves. By default, the steering values contained in the trajectory message are used. Parameter trajectory_preprocessing.calculate_steering_angles allows to recalculate these values when set to true . Footprint # The footprint of the bicycle model is created from lines parallel to the left and right simulated motion at a distance of half the vehicle width. In addition, the two points on the left and right of the end point of the central simulated motion are used to complete the polygon. Distance # The distance to a collision point is calculated by finding the curvature circle passing through the trajectory point and the collision point. Obstacle Detection # Obstacles are represented as points or linestrings (i.e., sequence of points) around the obstacles and are constructed from an occupancy grid, a pointcloud, or the lanelet map. The lanelet map is always checked for obstacles but the other source is switched using parameter obstacles.dynamic_source . To efficiently find obstacles intersecting with a footprint, they are stored in a R-tree . Two trees are used, one for the obstacle points, and one for the obstacle linestrings (which are decomposed into segments to simplify the R-tree). Obstacle masks # Dynamic obstacles # Moving obstacles such as other cars should not be considered by this module. These obstacles are detected by the perception modules and represented as polygons. Obstacles inside these polygons are ignored. Only dynamic obstacles with a velocity above parameter obstacles.dynamic_obstacles_min_vel are removed. To deal with delays and precision errors, the polygons can be enlarged with parameter obstacles.dynamic_obstacles_buffer . Obstacles outside of the safety envelope # Obstacles that are not inside any forward simulated footprint are ignored if parameter obstacles.filter_envelope is set to true. The safety envelope polygon is built from all the footprints and used as a positive mask on the occupancy grid or pointcloud. This option can reduce the total number of obstacles which reduces the cost of collision detection. However, the cost of masking the envelope is usually too high to be interesting. Obstacles on the ego path # If parameter obstacles.ignore_obstacles_on_path is set to true , a polygon mask is built from the trajectory and the vehicle dimension. Any obstacle in this polygon is ignored. The size of the polygon can be increased using parameter obstacles.ignore_extra_distance which is added to the vehicle lateral offset. This option is a bit expensive and should only be used in case of noisy dynamic obstacles where obstacles are wrongly detected on the ego path, causing unwanted velocity limits. Lanelet Map # Information about static obstacles can be stored in the Lanelet map using the value of the type tag of linestrings. If any linestring has a type with one of the value from parameter obstacles.static_map_tags , then it will be used as an obstacle. Obstacles from the lanelet map are not impacted by the masks. Occupancy Grid # Masking is performed by iterating through the cells inside each polygon mask using the grid_map_utils::PolygonIterator function. A threshold is then applied to only keep cells with an occupancy value above parameter obstacles.occupancy_grid_threshold . Finally, the image is converted to an image and obstacle linestrings are extracted using the opencv function findContour . Pointcloud # Masking is performed using the pcl::CropHull function. Points from the pointcloud are then directly used as obstacles. Velocity Adjustment # If a collision is found, the velocity at the trajectory point is adjusted such that the resulting footprint would no longer collide with an obstacle: velocity = \\frac{dist\\_to\\_collision}{min\\_ttc} velocity = \\frac{dist\\_to\\_collision}{min\\_ttc} To prevent sudden deceleration of the ego vehicle, the parameter max_deceleration limits the deceleration relative to the current ego velocity. For a trajectory point occuring at a duration t in the future (calculated from the original velocity profile), the adjusted velocity cannot be set lower than v_{current} - t * max\\_deceleration v_{current} - t * max\\_deceleration . Furthermore, a parameter min_adjusted_velocity provides a lower bound on the modified velocity. Trajectory preprocessing # The node only modifies part of the input trajectory, starting from the current ego position. Parameter trajectory_preprocessing.start_distance is used to adjust how far ahead of the ego position the velocities will start being modified. Parameters trajectory_preprocessing.max_length and trajectory_preprocessing.max_duration are used to control how much of the trajectory will see its velocity adjusted. To reduce computation cost at the cost of precision, the trajectory can be downsampled using parameter trajectory_preprocessing.downsample_factor . For example a value of 1 means all trajectory points will be evaluated while a value of 10 means only 1/10th of the points will be evaluated.

Notes # CPU monitor for intel platform # Thermal throttling event can be monitored by reading contents of MSR(Model Specific Register), and accessing MSR is only allowed for root by default, so this package provides the following approach to minimize security risks as much as possible: Provide a small program named 'msr_reader' which accesses MSR and sends thermal throttling status to CPU monitor by using socket programming. Run 'msr_reader' as a specific user instead of root. CPU monitor is able to know the status as an unprivileged user since thermal throttling status is sent by socket communication. Instructions before starting # Create a user to run 'msr_reader'. sudo adduser <username> Load kernel module 'msr' into your target system. The path '/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr' appears. sudo modprobe msr Allow user to access MSR with read-only privilege using the Access Control List (ACL). sudo setfacl -m u:<username>:r /dev/cpu/*/msr Assign capability to 'msr_reader' since msr kernel module requires rawio capability. sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio = ep install/system_monitor/lib/system_monitor/msr_reader Run 'msr_reader' as the user you created, and run system_monitor as a generic user. su <username> install/system_monitor/lib/system_monitor/msr_reader See also # msr_reader HDD Monitor # Generally, S.M.A.R.T. information is used to monitor HDD temperature and life of HDD, and normally accessing disk device node is allowed for root user or disk group. As with the CPU monitor, this package provides an approach to minimize security risks as much as possible: Provide a small program named 'hdd_reader' which accesses S.M.A.R.T. information and sends some items of it to HDD monitor by using socket programming. Run 'hdd_reader' as a specific user. HDD monitor is able to know some items of S.M.A.R.T. information as an unprivileged user since those are sent by socket communication. Instructions before starting # Create a user to run 'hdd_reader'. sudo adduser <username> Add user to the disk group. sudo usermod -a -G disk <username> Assign capabilities to 'hdd_reader' since SCSI kernel module requires rawio capability to send ATA PASS-THROUGH (12) command and NVMe kernel module requires admin capability to send Admin Command. sudo setcap 'cap_sys_rawio=ep cap_sys_admin=ep' install/system_monitor/lib/system_monitor/hdd_reader Run 'hdd_reader' as the user you created, and run system_monitor as a generic user. su <username> install/system_monitor/lib/system_monitor/hdd_reader See also # hdd_reader GPU Monitor for intel platform # Currently GPU monitor for intel platform only supports NVIDIA GPU whose information can be accessed by NVML API. Also you need to install CUDA libraries. For installation instructions for CUDA 10.0, see NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guide for Linux . Voltage monitor for CMOS Battery # Some platforms have built-in batteries for the RTC and CMOS. This node determines the battery status from the result of executing cat /proc/driver/rtc. Also, if lm-sensors is installed, it is possible to use the results. However, the return value of sensors varies depending on the chipset, so it is necessary to set a string to extract the corresponding voltage. It is also necessary to set the voltage for warning and error. For example, if you want a warning when the voltage is less than 2.9V and an error when it is less than 2.7V.

The base map, which is lexus's one by default, is updated iteratively with the loaded driving data. How to calibrate # Launch Calibrator # After launching Autoware, run the accel_brake_map_calibrator by the following command and then perform autonomous driving. Note: You can collect data with manual driving if it is possible to use the same vehicle interface as during autonomous driving (e.g. using a joystick). ros2 launch accel_brake_map_calibrator accel_brake_map_calibrator.launch.xml rviz: = true Or if you want to use rosbag files, run the following commands. ros2 launch accel_brake_map_calibrator accel_brake_map_calibrator.launch.xml rviz: = true use_sim_time: = true ros2 bag play <rosbag_file> --clock During the calibration with setting the parameter progress_file_output to true, the log file is output in [directory of accel_brake_map_calibrator ]/config/ . You can also see accel and brake maps in [directory of accel_brake_map_calibrator ]/config/accel_map.csv and [directory of accel_brake_map_calibrator ]/config/brake_map.csv after calibration. Calibration plugin # The rviz:=true option displays the RViz with a calibration plugin as below. The current status (velocity and pedal) is shown in the plugin. The color on the current cell varies green/red depending on the current data is valid/invalid. The data that doesn't satisfy the following conditions are considered invalid and will not be used for estimation since aggressive data (e.g. when the pedal is moving fast) causes bad calibration accuracy. The velocity and pedal conditions are within certain ranges from the index values. The steer value, pedal speed, pitch value, etc. are less than corresponding thresholds. The velocity is higher than a threshold. The detailed parameters are described in the parameter section. Note: You don't need to worry about whether the current state is red or green during calibration. Just keep getting data until all the cells turn red. The value of each cell in the map is gray at first, and it changes from blue to red as the number of valid data in the cell accumulates. It is preferable to continue the calibration until each cell of the map becomes close to red. In particular, the performance near the stop depends strongly on the velocity of 0 ~ 6m/s range and the pedal value of +0.2 ~ -0.4, range so it is desirable to focus on those areas. Diagnostics # The accel brake map_calibrator publishes diagnostics message depending on the calibration status. Diagnostic type WARN indicates that the current accel/brake map is estimated to be inaccurate. In this situation, it is strongly recommended to perform a re-calibration of the accel/brake map. Status Diagnostics Type Diagnostics message Description No calibration required OK \"OK\" Calibration Required WARN \"Accel/brake map Calibration is required.\" The accuracy of current accel/brake map may be low. This diagnostics status can be also checked on the following ROS topic. ros2 topic echo /accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/update_suggest When the diagnostics type is WARN , True is published on this topic and the update of the accel/brake map is suggested. Evaluation of the accel / brake map accuracy # The accuracy of map is evaluated by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the observed acceleration and predicted acceleration. TERMS: Observed acceleration : the current vehicle acceleration which is calculated as a derivative value of the wheel speed. Predicted acceleration : the output of the original accel/brake map, which the Autoware is expecting. The value is calculated using the current pedal and velocity. You can check additional error information with the following topics. /accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/current_map_error : The error of the original map set in the csv_path_accel/brake_map path. The original map is not accurate if this value is large. /accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/updated_map_error : The error of the map calibrated in this node. The calibration quality is low if this value is large. /accel_brake_map_calibrator/output/map_error_ratio : The error ratio between the original map and updated map (ratio = updated / current). If this value is less than 1, it is desirable to update the map. How to visualize calibration data # The process of calibration can be visualized as below. Since these scripts need the log output of the calibration, the pedal_accel_graph_output parameter must be set to true while the calibration is running for the visualization. Visualize plot of relation between acceleration and pedal # The following command shows the plot of used data in the calibration. In each plot of velocity ranges, you can see the distribution of the relationship between pedal and acceleration, and raw data points with colors according to their pitch angles. ros2 run accel_brake_map_calibrator view_plot.py Visualize statistics about acceleration/velocity/pedal data # The following command shows the statistics of the calibration: mean value standard deviation number of data of all data in each map cell. ros2 run accel_brake_map_calibrator view_statistics.py How to save the calibrated accel / brake map anytime you want # You can save accel and brake map anytime with the following command. ros2 service call /accel_brake_map_calibrator/update_map_dir tier4_vehicle_msgs/srv/UpdateAccelBrakeMap \"path: '<accel/brake map directory>'\" You can also save accel and brake map in the default directory where Autoware reads accel_map.csv/brake_map.csv using the RViz plugin (AccelBrakeMapCalibratorButtonPanel) as following.
